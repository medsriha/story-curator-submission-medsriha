For five long days, the two sides worked out the details of what would become the Magna Carta, or \"Great Charter.\" The barons presented their demands carefully. They said the king could no longer imprison free men without a proper trial by their peers. They demanded that he stop seizing property without following the law. Most shocking of all, they required that even the monarch himself must obey the rules. <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Theme (confidence: 0.70)\">This idea challenged the very foundation of medieval kingship.</span> John's advisors whispered in his ear during breaks. Some urged him to fight rather than give up his absolute power. Others warned that his treasury was empty and his army unreliable. The barons stayed united. They had spent months preparing for this moment. They had talked with church leaders and legal scholars to make sure their demands had solid foundations. <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Main Idea (confidence: 0.85)\">The negotiation showed a big shift in how people thought about power and justice.</span> For centuries, kings had claimed to rule by divine right. They answered only to God. The barons weren't challenging John's right to be king. But they were saying that his power had boundaries. They argued that law should stand above personal whim, even royal whim. On June fifteen, 1215, King John finally pressed his royal seal into the wax. This would bind him to the charter. The document had sixty three clauses. These addressed everything from tax collection to the rights of merchants. Clause thirty nine became very important: \"No free man shall be seized or imprisoned... except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.\" What happened next proved difficult. <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Character Analysis (confidence: 0.80)\">John almost right away began looking for ways to break his promises.</span> <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Cause and Effect (confidence: 0.75)\">Civil war broke out within months.</span> The king died the following year, still fighting his barons. But the precedent had been set. Future rulers would face the Magna Carta's principles again and again. Subjects would demand that their leaders respect legal boundaries. The five days at Runnymede had planted a seed. This seed would grow into constitutional government. It would influence legal systems across the world. <span class=\"skill-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple skills - Comprehension: Main Idea; Comprehension: Theme\">The idea that law could limit power took root.</span> The idea that rulers must follow rules took root. <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Theme (confidence: 0.70)\">The idea that people deserved protection from unfair authority took root.</span> All of this happened in a meadow beside an English river, changing human governance forever."

Amerigo Vespucci , an Italian navigator, made several trips across the Atlantic between 1497 and 1504 CE. Vespucci's missions were funded by various sponsors, including the powerful Medici family of Florence, now part of Italy. His writings of his journeys made him one of the most famous explorers of his time. Vespucci's findings helped change Europeans' understanding of the world. They also contributed to greater exploration and colonization of the Americas. Vespucci is credited with being the first to recognize that the lands he explored were not part of Asia. He used the term \"New World\" to describe this place. A German mapmaker was so impressed with Vespucci's writings that he labeled the new continent America on the map he was working on."

This is a strip of cells that run along the sides of its body and into its head. This line picks up sound and movement. The sounds the shark hears best are at the low end of the sound range, too low for people to hear. It also picks up the slightest water movement. It is alert to any thrashing movements, signs that a fish might be hurt and easy to catch. <span class=\"skill-knowledge\" style=\"background-color: #f39c12; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Knowledge: Animals (confidence: 0.90)\">Sharks see best in dim light, which is why they tend to hunt in early morning or at night.</span> They also have a sixth sense. <span class=\"skill-knowledge\" style=\"background-color: #f39c12; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Knowledge: Animals (confidence: 0.90)\">Every animal gives off a weak electric current when it is in water.</span> Sharks have pores, or small openings, on their heads that tell them where the current is coming from.

It has several rows of them. Most rows are slanted toward the rear of the mouth. Each row is slightly larger than the last. When the shark bites a victim, its sharp teeth slice through the flesh. The rear teeth hold fast to the victim. It is easy to get something into a shark's mouth, but try getting it back out! The shark always has the same number of teeth. If a tooth is lost, another grows in its place.

The arrival of European explorer Captain James Cook to this Pacific archipelago in 1778 had sparked interest among other explorers and traders. An 1848 Hawaiian law allowed foreigners to own land. As a result, sugar plantations began to flourish in Hawaii. They were staffed by workers from countries such as China, Korea, Norway, Portugal, the Philippines, and Russia. Sugar exports from Hawaii became big business. Foreign planters gained considerable economic and political influence in Hawaii. In addition to business interests, more than one hundred and eighty Christian missionaries from the United States arrived on the islands between 1820 and 1863.

They had marched through city streets and organized rallies. They had even gone to prison for their beliefs. The 19th Amendment would guarantee women's suffrage nationwide. It had already passed through Congress. But it needed ratification from thirty six states to become law. Thirty five states had already approved the amendment. This made Tennessee the decisive battleground. The Tennessee legislature was deadlocked. Anti suffrage forces argued that giving women the vote would destroy traditional families. Pro suffrage advocates disagreed. They said democracy demanded equal participation from all citizens. Each side had gathered their supporters.

Her letter contained a simple but powerful message: \"Dear Son, Hurrah, and vote for suffrage! Don't keep them in doubt. I notice some of the speeches against. They were bitter.

It's possible this event happened over a century or so. Until the 900s, the Maya kept careful historical records. They used their hieroglyphs to carve names and dates on pyramids and temples. Then in the 900s, the writing mysteriously stopped. The temples and pyramids began to fall into disrepair.

Other researchers disagree. Did disaster strike the Maya? Was there an earthquake? Could invaders have toppled the civilization? Did shifting trade routes affect the lowland Maya rulers and their settlements? It is possible that overland trade routes gave way to more sea based trade routes. This may have occurred because it was more efficient to move goods by sea. <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Character Analysis (confidence: 0.70)\">Many Maya may have elected to move closer to the sea to escape the drought or to escape growing conflict between the city states.</span> <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Main Idea (confidence: 0.85)\">No one knows for sure why the once great Maya cities were abandoned and swallowed up by the rainforest.</span> It could be a combination of the reasons researchers have posed.

But that is what happened. Born in the year nineteen sixty in Sanford, North Carolina, Bray joined Reserve Officers' Training Corps in the year nineteen eighty two. Then she served as a military policewoman in Germany. In the year nineteen eighty nine, Bray was commanding a company of military police during the United States' invasion of Panama. Military police are in charge of protecting bases and military outposts. They are the law enforcement arm of the military, and they are considered noncombatants. <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Theme (confidence: 0.70)\">At the time, women were not supposed to participate in combat in the United States military.</span> But military police have assault teams, too. That is what Bray was leading when her team received orders to infiltrate a dog kennel held by the Panamanian Defense Forces. Bray and her team of nearly all men broke into the kennel and exchanged gunfire with the enemy soldiers hiding inside. What they expected to be a ten minute mission turned into a three hour firefight. Most of the Panamanian soldiers fled, and Bray's team found a cache of weapons and ammunition inside. <span class=\"skill-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple skills - Comprehension: Character Analysis; Comprehension: Cause and Effect; Comprehension: Theme\">Bray had performed bravely and admirably, but she'd also become part of a controversy.</span> <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Cause and Effect (confidence: 0.70)\">Many felt that the mission had crossed the line between peacekeeping and offensive combat.</span> <span class=\"skill-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple skills - Comprehension: Cause and Effect; Comprehension: Theme\">For the very first time, United States troops had been led by a woman in combat.</span> <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Character Analysis (confidence: 0.85)\">Bray came under intense scrutiny for what she had done.</span>"

Hopeful homesteaders lined up with their applications. They swore they had never fought against the United States government. The law welcomed citizens and immigrants alike. This included single women and freed slaves. However, married women could not file claims on their own. <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Key Details (confidence: 0.80)\">Each applicant got a certificate and six months to begin building their new life.</span> The real challenge started after filing. Homestead law demanded five years of living on the land and farming it. Settlers had to build a home. Even a simple sod house counted. They also had to farm part of their land. Government inspectors would come to check these requirements. They looked at everything from crop yields to building sizes. Daniel Freeman became the first official homesteader. He filed his claim near Beatrice, Nebraska, just after midnight on January one, 1863. His story shows the Act's promise. Freeman was a Union soldier who used his military service to meet residency requirements while stationed nearby. Within decades, his successful farm showed how the legislation could change both individual lives and entire regions. <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Cause and Effect (confidence: 0.70)\">The impact on population was huge.</span> <span class=\"skill-knowledge\" style=\"background-color: #f39c12; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Knowledge: Historical Events (confidence: 0.90)\">Between 1862 and 1934, when the Act finally ended, over one point six million homestead applications were filed.</span> Census data shows how entire states changed almost overnight. Nebraska's population exploded from twenty eight thousand in 1860 to over four hundred and fifty thousand by 1880. Similar patterns happened across Kansas, Colorado, and the Dakotas. Railroad companies advertised the opportunities. Immigrant communities helped each other succeed. Original claim documents tell amazing stories of determination. Swedish immigrants clustered in Minnesota. They brought farming techniques from Scandinavia. African American homesteaders moved to Kansas. They created all black towns like Nicodemus, seeking economic independence after slavery ended. Single women made up nearly twenty percent of all homesteaders. This challenged old ideas about frontier life. Agricultural development grew rapidly under the Act's influence. <span class=\"skill-vocabulary\" style=\"background-color: #e74c3c; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Vocabulary: Context Clues (confidence: 0.60)\">Settlers brought new crops suited to prairie conditions.</span> This included drought resistant wheat varieties.

Railroad companies and land speculators sometimes cheated the system. They used fake homesteaders to get valuable territory. <span class=\"skill-comprehension\" style=\"background-color: #27ae60; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Comprehension: Cause and Effect (confidence: 0.70)\">These abuses sparked debates about the legislation's fairness.</span> This led to reforms and additional land laws. <span class=\"skill-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple skills - Comprehension: Main Idea; Knowledge: Historical Events\">The Homestead Act changed American agriculture and settlement patterns forever.</span> It gave two hundred and seventy million acres of public land directly to individual families. That was an area larger than Texas and New Mexico combined. This massive land transfer created the foundation for modern American farming. It established the principle that ordinary citizens deserved opportunities to build wealth through land ownership. The legislation's legacy extends beyond agriculture into American identity itself. It embedded the belief that hard work could transform both landscape and fortune."
