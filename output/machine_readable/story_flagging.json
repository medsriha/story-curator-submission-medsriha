She pursued her medical studies in Pennsylvania, once again graduating at the top of her class. Anne returned to her home state of South Carolina after completing her medical education. Before she could officially practice medicine, she needed to pass the state medical examination. Anne didn't just pass the exam, she achieved the highest score recorded in the state at that time. In the early years of her practice, Anne navigated the rough roads of Anderson County in an old car, making house calls to attend to her patients. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Stereotypes; Medium: Bullying or meanness\">Locals often said, \"There goes that strange woman doctor.\"</span>",

King John of England sat across from twenty five of his most powerful barons. These men controlled vast lands and commanded thousands of knights. This wasn't an ordinary meeting. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">This was a showdown that would reshape how rulers and subjects related forever.</span> For months, the barons had grown angry with their monarch. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; High: Bullying or meanness\">John had demanded crushing taxes to fund his failed wars in France.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; High: Bullying or meanness\">He had seized their lands without trial.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; High: Bullying or meanness; High: Violence & Physical Harm; Medium: Family dysfunction\">He had imprisoned their relatives without cause.</span> He had ignored every tradition that had governed English kings before him.

They said the king could no longer imprison free men without a proper trial by their peers. They demanded that he stop seizing property without following the law. Most shocking of all, they required that even the monarch himself must obey the rules. This idea challenged the very foundation of medieval kingship. John's advisors whispered in his ear during breaks. Some urged him to fight rather than give up his absolute power. Others warned that his treasury was empty and his army unreliable. The barons stayed united. They had spent months preparing for this moment. They had talked with church leaders and legal scholars to make sure their demands had solid foundations. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">The negotiation showed a big shift in how people thought about power and justice.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">For centuries, kings had claimed to rule by divine right.</span> They answered only to God. The barons weren't challenging John's right to be king.

This would bind him to the charter. The document had sixty three clauses. These addressed everything from tax collection to the rights of merchants. Clause thirty nine became very important: \"No free man shall be seized or imprisoned... except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.\" What happened next proved difficult. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; Medium: Complex emotional content; Medium: Family dysfunction\">John almost right away began looking for ways to break his promises.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; Medium: Complex emotional content; Medium: Family dysfunction; High: Violence & Physical Harm; Medium: Hopelessness\">Civil war broke out within months.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; Medium: Complex emotional content; High: Violence & Physical Harm; Medium: Hopelessness\">The king died the following year, still fighting his barons.</span> But the precedent had been set.

This seed would grow into constitutional government. It would influence legal systems across the world. The idea that law could limit power took root. The idea that rulers must follow rules took root. The idea that people deserved protection from unfair authority took root. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">All of this happened in a meadow beside an English river, changing human governance forever.</span>",

Christopher Columbus was an Italian sailor who believed he could find a new way to get to Cathay. He hoped to secure some of its wealth through trade. Rather than sailing east, Columbus thought he could sail west from Europe. He asked European leaders for money to test his theory. Columbus eventually got support from King Ferdinand Two and Queen Isabella One of Spain. They were willing to take the risk because if Columbus succeeded, Spain could gain wealth and power and also spread Christianity. In September of 1492 CE, Columbus set off westward from the Canary Islands. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Complex emotional content; Medium: Bullying or meanness\">According to some who sailed with Columbus, many sailors wept.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Complex emotional content; Medium: Bullying or meanness\">They were fearful of what lay ahead.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Complex emotional content; Medium: Bullying or meanness; High: Violence & Physical Harm; High: Unsafe behaviors modeled\">After a month on the open ocean without any sign of land, the crew threatened mutiny.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Complex emotional content; Medium: Bullying or meanness; High: Unsafe behaviors modeled\">Many of the men feared they had traveled so far west that they would never find their way back to Europe.</span> But on October twelve, they landed in the Bahamas and then they went farther.

His writings of his journeys made him one of the most famous explorers of his time. Vespucci's findings helped change Europeans' understanding of the world. They also contributed to greater exploration and colonization of the Americas. Vespucci is credited with being the first to recognize that the lands he explored were not part of Asia. He used the term \"New World\" to describe this place. A German mapmaker was so impressed with Vespucci's writings that he labeled the new continent America on the map he was working on.",

He inquired anxiously whether I had courage or firmness to remain in the President's house until his return tomorrow, or the succeeding day. And on my assurance that I had no fear but for him, and the success of our army, he left, urging me to take care of myself, and of the Cabinet papers, public and private. I have since received two dispatches from him, written with a pencil. The last is alarming because he desires I should be ready at a moment's notice to enter my carriage, and leave the city. He said that the enemy seemed stronger than had at first been reported, and it might happen that they would reach the city with the intention of destroying it. I am accordingly ready. I have pressed as many Cabinet papers into trunks as to fill one carriage. Our private property must be sacrificed, as it is impossible to procure wagons for its transportation. I am determined not to go myself until I see mister Madison is safe, so that he can accompany me, as I hear of much hostility toward him. Disaffection stalks around us. My friends and acquaintances are all gone.

Then, in the year nineteen ninety six, she was hired as chief of staff for the United States Secretary of the Treasury. But political jobs like that one often change hands when a new president is elected. When a Republican president was elected Sheryl decided to take a risk and join the private sector. She accepted a job at what was then a budding tech company called Google. At a press conference in Paris in the year twenty seventeen, Sheryl Sandberg announced that Facebook would help support startup tech companies. It was her next job, however, that made her a household name. Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, met her at a Christmas party in two thousand eight. Recognizing her intelligence and drive, Zuckerberg named her chief operating officer of Facebook. Today she runs the business side of the social media company. That allows developers to focus on what Facebook can do for the two billion people who use it every month. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">Carrying on her family's tradition, Sandberg has used what she learned leading Google and Facebook to help other people, especially women.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">Her book \"Lean In\" sparked a nationwide movement to help millions of women overcome barriers.</span> The barriers stop them from achieving the success they would like to have in business.",

She was strong and smart. She helped make the country we know today. Sacagawea was born near the Rocky Mountains in the late seventeen hundreds. The area was not part of the United States yet.

Creel and those who worked with him recruited thousands of \"Four Minute Men,\" who gave short, four minute speeches in support of America's war effort. \"Four Minute Men\" spoke across America on street corners, in movie theaters, in churches, and in other places where people gathered.

So prepare, say a prayer, Send the word, send the word to beware. We'll be over, we're coming over, And we won't come back till it's over, Over there. Large numbers of men left their jobs to serve in the United States armed forces. At the same time, many women stepped up to work in war industries. They assembled bombs and built airplanes and ships.

If you purchased a Liberty Bond, you gave money to the US. government, and the government would pay you back with a small amount of interest after the war. Rallies large and small were held across the country to urge people to buy Liberty Bonds. Another way Americans contributed on the home front was by planting \"victory gardens.\" Given the number of men away at war, there was both an agricultural labor shortage and a need to send food to troops overseas. As a result, the nation faced food shortages and rationing. Many people grew their own fruits and vegetables on small plots of land to help with these shortages and foster a shared sense of purpose by contributing to the war effort from home.",

How land was distributed varied across the colonial regions. In New England, groups coming to the colonies were given a plot of land to form a town. The town's leaders were responsible for laying out the town and dividing the land among its inhabitants. They also decided what land to give each individual or family. New England towns had a town center and common lands shared by all townspeople to graze their livestock. Land distribution and ownership was very different in the Southern colonies. People living in this region developed larger tracts of land to grow cash crops. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Family dysfunction; High: Stereotypes\">Over time, indentured servants who had served out their contracts were given land.</span> Colonists in Virginia spread westward from the coast along the James River.

They were found in all colonial regions, mostly in coastal towns and cities. Artisans were responsible for providing valuable goods and services, including shipbuilding, carpentry, shoemaking, baking, and silversmithing. Some colonial artisans were master craftspeople who had studied and practiced their trade for many years. To learn a trade, children as young as thirteen worked as an apprentice for a master. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Family dysfunction\">Apprentices were similar to indentured servants.</span> They worked for a set number of years without earning a wage.

    "highlighted_text": "The Tennessee State Capitol buzzed with tension on August eighteen, 1920. Legislators filled the chamber. Their voices echoed off marble walls as they prepared for one of the most important votes in American history. The nation watched this single building in Nashville. The fate of women's suffrage hung in the balance. For decades, women across America had fought for the right to vote. They had marched through city streets and organized rallies. They had even gone to prison for their beliefs. The 19th Amendment would guarantee women's suffrage nationwide. It had already passed through Congress. But it needed ratification from thirty six states to become law. Thirty five states had already approved the amendment. This made Tennessee the decisive battleground. The Tennessee legislature was deadlocked. Anti suffrage forces argued that giving women the vote would destroy traditional families. Pro suffrage advocates disagreed. They said democracy demanded equal participation from all citizens. Each side had gathered their supporters. This created a standoff that seemed impossible to break. Among the legislators sat Harry T. Burn. He was a twenty four year old Republican from McMinn County. As one of the youngest members of the Tennessee House of Representatives, Burn had opposed the amendment. He wore a red rose on his lapel. This was the symbol of anti suffrage sentiment. It showed his planned vote against ratification. That morning, Burn had received a letter from his mother, Febb Burn. She lived back home in Niota. Mrs. Burn had followed the suffrage debate closely. She held strong opinions about her son's responsibility. Her letter contained a simple but powerful message: \"Dear Son, Hurrah, and vote for suffrage! Don't keep them in doubt. I notice some of the speeches against. They were bitter. I have been watching to see how you stood, but have not noticed anything yet. Don't forget to be a good boy and help Mrs. Catt put the 'rat' in ratification.\" The reference to Carrie Chapman Catt showed Mrs. Burn's deep knowledge of the movement. Catt was a prominent suffrage leader. Mrs. Burn's playful wordplay about putting the \"rat\" in ratification showed both her wit and her serious commitment to the cause. As the roll call began, tension filled the chamber. When the clerk called \"Burn,\" the young legislator stood. The red rose still decorated his jacket. But his voice carried unexpected words: \"I vote aye.\" Gasps echoed through the gallery. Spectators realized what had happened. Harry Burn had broken the deadlock with a single, decisive vote. The final count showed fifty votes in favor and forty nine against ratification. Tennessee became the thirty sixth state to approve the 19th Amendment. This provided the necessary majority for it to become part of the Constitution. Within days, Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby certified the amendment. This officially granted American women the right to vote. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Bullying or meanness\">Burn's decision sparked immediate controversy.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Bullying or meanness; Medium: Exclusion\">Anti suffrage legislators accused him of betrayal.</span> Suffrage supporters celebrated his courage. The young legislator later explained his reasoning: \"I know that a mother's advice is always safest for her boy to follow, and my mother wanted me to vote for ratification.\" This single vote transformed American democracy. The 19th Amendment gave voting rights to about twenty six million women. It doubled the eligible voting population overnight. Harry Burn's willingness to reconsider his position showed how individual conscience could reshape history. The letter from Febb Burn represents more than maternal guidance. It embodies the determination of countless women who fought for political equality. Through one young legislator's change of heart, their decades of struggle finally achieved victory.",

Then in the 900s, the writing mysteriously stopped. The temples and pyramids began to fall into disrepair.

Other researchers disagree. Did disaster strike the Maya? Was there an earthquake? Could invaders have toppled the civilization? Did shifting trade routes affect the lowland Maya rulers and their settlements? It is possible that overland trade routes gave way to more sea based trade routes. This may have occurred because it was more efficient to move goods by sea. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Violence & Physical Harm; Medium: Confusing structure; Medium: Mature themes\">Many Maya may have elected to move closer to the sea to escape the drought or to escape growing conflict between the city states.</span> No one knows for sure why the once great Maya cities were abandoned and swallowed up by the rainforest. It could be a combination of the reasons researchers have posed. We know that many centuries ago, the Maya left their cities behind. But the people themselves did not disappear. They relocated to new settlements, often closer to the coast. Today, millions still speak languages related to ancient Mayan. These descendants of the pyramid builders have lived in villages, towns, and cities in southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras for centuries. Some carry on the traditions and lifestyle of their ancestors, while others live a modern lifestyle. Many Maya blend traditional and modern ways of life.",

For just a ten dollar filing fee, settlers could stake their claim to one hundred and sixty acres of government land. That was roughly the size of one hundred and twenty football fields. The process began at local land offices across the frontier. Hopeful homesteaders lined up with their applications. They swore they had never fought against the United States government. The law welcomed citizens and immigrants alike. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Misrepresentation\">This included single women and freed slaves.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Misrepresentation; Medium: Exclusion; Medium: Missing context\">However, married women could not file claims on their own.</span> Each applicant got a certificate and six months to begin building their new life. The real challenge started after filing. Homestead law demanded five years of living on the land and farming it. Settlers had to build a home. Even a simple sod house counted. They also had to farm part of their land. Government inspectors would come to check these requirements. They looked at everything from crop yields to building sizes. Daniel Freeman became the first official homesteader. He filed his claim near Beatrice, Nebraska, just after midnight on January one, 1863. His story shows the Act's promise. Freeman was a Union soldier who used his military service to meet residency requirements while stationed nearby. Within decades, his successful farm showed how the legislation could change both individual lives and entire regions. The impact on population was huge. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">Between 1862 and 1934, when the Act finally ended, over one point six million homestead applications were filed.</span> Census data shows how entire states changed almost overnight. Nebraska's population exploded from twenty eight thousand in 1860 to over four hundred and fifty thousand by 1880. Similar patterns happened across Kansas, Colorado, and the Dakotas. Railroad companies advertised the opportunities. Immigrant communities helped each other succeed. Original claim documents tell amazing stories of determination. Swedish immigrants clustered in Minnesota. They brought farming techniques from Scandinavia. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Misrepresentation; Medium: Missing context\">African American homesteaders moved to Kansas.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Misrepresentation\">They created all black towns like Nicodemus, seeking economic independence after slavery ended.</span> Single women made up nearly twenty percent of all homesteaders. This challenged old ideas about frontier life. Agricultural development grew rapidly under the Act's influence. Settlers brought new crops suited to prairie conditions. This included drought resistant wheat varieties. These crops would eventually make the Great Plains America's breadbasket. The legislation encouraged trying new farming techniques. These ranged from dry farming methods to new irrigation systems. The Act's success rate tells a complex story. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">While one point six million claims were filed, only about seven hundred and eighty three thousand homesteaders successfully completed the five year requirement.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Hopelessness\">Harsh weather, crop failures, and isolation defeated many dreams.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Hopelessness\">Some settlers found their one hundred and sixty acres had poor soil or not enough water.</span> Railroad companies and land speculators sometimes cheated the system. They used fake homesteaders to get valuable territory. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">These abuses sparked debates about the legislation's fairness.</span> This led to reforms and additional land laws. The Homestead Act changed American agriculture and settlement patterns forever. It gave two hundred and seventy million acres of public land directly to individual families. That was an area larger than Texas and New Mexico combined. This massive land transfer created the foundation for modern American farming. It established the principle that ordinary citizens deserved opportunities to build wealth through land ownership. The legislation's legacy extends beyond agriculture into American identity itself. It embedded the belief that hard work could transform both landscape and fortune.",

Some black bears in the far north are blue gray or creamy white. Male black bears are larger than females. Some measure more than 6 feet (1.8 meters) long.

Her autobiography, The Narrative of Sojourner Truth, was written with Olive Gilbert's help in 1850 because she could not read or write. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Low: Formatting artifacts; Medium: Confusing structure\">Onen 1851, Truth was invited to speak at an Akron, Ohio, women's rights conference, where she delivered her famous speech \"Ain't One a Woman?\"</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Low: Formatting artifacts; Medium: Confusing structure\">Onen it, she challenged the idea that women were somehow less able than men.</span> In addition to Stanton, Mott, and Truth, other remarkable women played key roles in the women's rights movement. One of them was Lucy Stone, known for being the first American woman to give a public speech on women's rights. When Lucy Stone married, she made the unconventional decision to keep her own name. Mary Church Terrell, an African American suffragist, fought for equal rights for women of all races. Margaret Fuller challenged gender roles and expectations with her powerful words and intellect. Additionally, Susan B. Anthony made significant contributions by tirelessly campaigning for women's suffrage and equal rights. Susan B. Anthony was an important American reformer. Born in 1820, she dedicated her life to advocating for women's suffrage. Anthony co founded the American Equal Rights Association with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and played a key role in the fight for the Nineteenth Amendment, which extended suffrage to women. Anthony's powerful speeches inspired countless women across the nation to join the suffrage movement. Her determination and relentless efforts made her a trailblazer in the fight for gender equality, leaving a lasting impact on American history. Another influential woman was Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to graduate from a medical college. Her accomplishments paved the way for women in the field of medicine. Amelia Bloomer, who introduced Elizabeth Cady Stanton to Susan B. Anthony, was also part of the movement. She challenged traditional clothing norms by wearing loose, comfortable trousers with a short skirt over them. This practical attire offered women more freedom of movement compared to cumbersome dresses. It took time for significant change to occur. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Complex emotional content\">The women's rights movement faced obstacles, but the determination and conviction of these courageous women set the stage for progress.</span> In the following decades, support for increased rights for women would grow. Finally, with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, women won the right to vote.",

    "highlighted_text": "School is over and everywhere children rush out the doors of their schools. But wait! Is it really over for the day? Well, not completely. There is homework to do. In most schools in America, kids have homework every night of school. It usually starts with only a little in kindergarten or first grade, but by high school it can take more than two hours to finish. Homework gives students a chance to practice and remember what they learned in school. However, not everyone thinks homework is a good idea. Some people think students need more time to do other things like sports and music. Some parents wish that their kids had more free time to be with their families. In this book, you will read about different points of view on homework. You will hear from people who think it helps children learn more in school. You will also hear from people who think that there's too much homework and that it's a waste of time. You probably already have ideas about this important topic.

The law also limited how much homework high school students were given. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">However, when the Russians sent the first satellite into space in 1957, Americans started to worry.</span> Why hadn't the United States done that first? <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">Americans worried that their schools were falling behind schools in the rest of the world.</span> Maybe students needed more homework after all. As people's views changed, students began getting homework in many schools. Rules against homework such as California's 1901 law were dropped. But does homework help all students? <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">There are studies that show homework can help students, but in different ways.</span> Homework has been shown to help elementary and middle school students learn good study habits, such as finishing tasks. For high school students, homework can help raise student grades and test scores. However, teachers have to be careful not to give too much homework. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">Scientists have found that too much homework can hurt students by lowering students' grades and test scores.</span> But how much is too much? <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">More than about two and one half hours of homework per night can have a negative effect on students' learning.</span> Based on scientists' findings, the National PTA has made suggestions on the amount of homework students should get every day.

    "highlighted_text": "In February 1862, the United States government faced a crisis. The Civil War had been raging for nearly a year. The Union treasury was rapidly emptying. Traditional methods of raising money could not keep pace with the enormous costs of war. Something new had to be done. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">Congress made a decision that would change American economics forever.</span> On February twenty five, 1862, President Lincoln signed the Legal Tender Act. This law authorized the printing of one hundred and fifty million dollars in paper currency that was not backed by gold or silver. These bills were printed with green ink on the back. They became known as \"greenbacks.\" <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">For the first time in American history, the federal government created money that got its value from the government's promise alone.</span> This idea challenged centuries of tradition. Before greenbacks, American currency was confusing. Each state bank issued its own paper money. These bills were backed by different amounts of gold or silver. The result was chaos. A merchant might see dozens of different currencies in a single day. Each had uncertain value. The greenbacks were different. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">This unbacked currency gained its worth through government decree rather than precious metals.</span> Critics called it \"rag money.\" They predicted economic disaster. They argued that only currency backed by gold or silver could keep stable value over time. Supporters disagreed. They said the government's authority to declare something as legal tender gave greenbacks real value. The Union's survival depended on finding new ways to pay for the war. Traditional funding methods had failed. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">The Legal Tender Act expanded federal economic power in ways never seen before.</span> The greenbacks created immediate controversy. Some businesses refused to accept the new currency. They preferred gold or silver coins. However, the legal tender provision meant creditors had to accept greenbacks as payment for debts. This government backing slowly built confidence in the new money system. The economic effects were complex. Greenbacks helped finance Union victory. They provided resources to maintain armies and buy equipment. However, printing money without backing also caused inflation. More currency chased the same amount of goods. Prices rose significantly during the war years. This affected both soldiers and civilians. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Confusing structure; Medium: Missing context\">The greenback experiment established important precedents for modern American money policy.</span> The Legal Tender Act showed that the federal government could create a unified national currency. It could regulate that currency's value. This principle later influenced the creation of the Federal Reserve System. It shaped twentieth century economic policy. The success of greenbacks during the war proved that unbacked currency could work. The government's promise to accept the money for taxes and debts gave it real value. Citizens learned to trust paper money that was not backed by precious metals. This trust became the foundation of modern monetary systems. The greenback revolution marked a turning point in American financial history. What began as a wartime emergency became a fundamental shift. Americans learned new ways to think about money, government authority, and economic power. The green tinted bills that helped save the Union also created the foundation for today's American monetary system. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 proved that sometimes the most radical solutions become the most lasting changes.",
