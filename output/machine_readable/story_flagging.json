Before she could officially practice medicine, she needed to pass the state medical examination. Anne didn't just pass the exam, she achieved the highest score recorded in the state at that time. In the early years of her practice, Anne navigated the rough roads of Anderson County in an old car, making house calls to attend to her patients. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Stereotypes; Medium: Bullying or meanness\">Locals often said, \"There goes that strange woman doctor.\"</span>",

    "highlighted_text": "The meadow at Runnymede stretched green beside the Thames River in June 1215. The air felt thick with tension. King John of England sat across from twenty five of his most powerful barons. These men controlled vast lands and commanded thousands of knights. This wasn't an ordinary meeting. This was a showdown that would reshape how rulers and subjects related forever. For months, the barons had grown angry with their monarch. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; High: Bullying or meanness\">John had demanded crushing taxes to fund his failed wars in France.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; High: Bullying or meanness\">He had seized their lands without trial.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; High: Bullying or meanness; High: Violence & Physical Harm; Medium: Family dysfunction\">He had imprisoned their relatives without cause.</span> He had ignored every tradition that had governed English kings before him. The barons had reached their limit. They had captured London and now held the upper hand in this negotiation. The king faced a terrible choice. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - High: Violence & Physical Harm; Medium: Mature themes\">He could refuse their demands and watch his kingdom tear apart in civil war.</span> Or he could agree to something no English ruler had ever accepted: written limits on royal power. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">For five long days, the two sides worked out the details of what would become the Magna Carta, or \"Great Charter.\"</span> The barons presented their demands carefully. They said the king could no longer imprison free men without a proper trial by their peers. They demanded that he stop seizing property without following the law. Most shocking of all, they required that even the monarch himself must obey the rules. This idea challenged the very foundation of medieval kingship. John's advisors whispered in his ear during breaks. Some urged him to fight rather than give up his absolute power. Others warned that his treasury was empty and his army unreliable. The barons stayed united. They had spent months preparing for this moment. They had talked with church leaders and legal scholars to make sure their demands had solid foundations. The negotiation showed a big shift in how people thought about power and justice. For centuries, kings had claimed to rule by divine right. They answered only to God. The barons weren't challenging John's right to be king. But they were saying that his power had boundaries. They argued that law should stand above personal whim, even royal whim. On June fifteen, 1215, King John finally pressed his royal seal into the wax. This would bind him to the charter. The document had sixty three clauses. These addressed everything from tax collection to the rights of merchants. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">Clause thirty nine became very important: \"No free man shall be seized or imprisoned... except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.\"</span> What happened next proved difficult. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; Medium: Complex emotional content; Medium: Family dysfunction\">John almost right away began looking for ways to break his promises.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; Medium: Complex emotional content; Medium: Family dysfunction; High: Violence & Physical Harm; Medium: Hopelessness\">Civil war broke out within months.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; Medium: Complex emotional content; High: Violence & Physical Harm; Medium: Hopelessness\">The king died the following year, still fighting his barons.</span> But the precedent had been set. Future rulers would face the Magna Carta's principles again and again. Subjects would demand that their leaders respect legal boundaries. The five days at Runnymede had planted a seed. This seed would grow into constitutional government. It would influence legal systems across the world. The idea that law could limit power took root. The idea that rulers must follow rules took root. The idea that people deserved protection from unfair authority took root. All of this happened in a meadow beside an English river, changing human governance forever.",

She wanted to help the bank achieve its mission of decreasing global poverty. Sandberg's job was researching data, but she did have a chance to see what the numbers meant in the real world. She traveled to clinics in remote parts of India, where World Bank funds helped people suffering from the disease of leprosy. She went back to Harvard to get an advanced degree in business. Then, in the year nineteen ninety six, she was hired as chief of staff for the United States Secretary of the Treasury. But political jobs like that one often change hands when a new president is elected. When a Republican president was elected Sheryl decided to take a risk and join the private sector. She accepted a job at what was then a budding tech company called Google. At a press conference in Paris in the year twenty seventeen, Sheryl Sandberg announced that Facebook would help support startup tech companies. It was her next job, however, that made her a household name. Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, met her at a Christmas party in two thousand eight. Recognizing her intelligence and drive, Zuckerberg named her chief operating officer of Facebook. Today she runs the business side of the social media company. That allows developers to focus on what Facebook can do for the two billion people who use it every month. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">Carrying on her family's tradition, Sandberg has used what she learned leading Google and Facebook to help other people, especially women.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">Her book \"Lean In\" sparked a nationwide movement to help millions of women overcome barriers.</span> The barriers stop them from achieving the success they would like to have in business.",

There were posters of all sorts. <span class=\"flag-high\" style=\"background-color: #ff6b6b; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"High: Unclear target audience\">One poster, appealing to young men, read, \"Uncle Sam Wants You to Join the Army.\"</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Critical: Hate Speech or Slurs; Medium: Violence & Physical Harm; Medium: Mature themes; Medium: Missing context; High: Stereotypes; Medium: Bullying or meanness\">Another poster portrayed a German soldier as a giant, vicious, bloodthirsty ape on the attack.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">Via these short speeches and posters, as well as movies and pamphlets and other ways, the United States government undertook an active propaganda campaign to build support and enthusiasm for America's involvement in the war.</span> Along with the efforts of the CPI, the American songwriter George Cohan sought to inspire excitement and support for America's war effort. In 1917, the year the United States entered World War One, Cohan wrote a song he titled \"Over There.\" By \"over there,\" he meant in Europe. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Mature themes; High: Unclear target audience\">It was a patriotic and popular song, though its critics said that it glorified war.</span> <span class=\"flag-high\" style=\"background-color: #ff6b6b; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"High: Unclear target audience\">The song sought to inspire young American men to join the US.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Violence & Physical Harm\">Army and fight against the Germans.</span> The song's chorus, in which \"the Yanks\" referred to American soldiers, went as follows: Over there, over there, Send the word, send the word over there That the Yanks are coming, The Yanks are coming The drums rum tumming Everywhere. So prepare, say a prayer, Send the word, send the word to beware. We'll be over, we're coming over, And we won't come back till it's over, Over there. Large numbers of men left their jobs to serve in the United States armed forces. At the same time, many women stepped up to work in war industries. They assembled bombs and built airplanes and ships. Women made bandages, sold war bonds, served as trolley car conductors, worked as office clerks, and much more. W. E.

For example, they bought Liberty Bonds to help fund the war. If you purchased a Liberty Bond, you gave money to the US. government, and the government would pay you back with a small amount of interest after the war. Rallies large and small were held across the country to urge people to buy Liberty Bonds. Another way Americans contributed on the home front was by planting \"victory gardens.\" Given the number of men away at war, there was both an agricultural labor shortage and a need to send food to troops overseas. As a result, the nation faced food shortages and rationing. Many people grew their own fruits and vegetables on small plots of land to help with these shortages and foster a shared sense of purpose by contributing to the war effort from home.",

How land was distributed varied across the colonial regions. In New England, groups coming to the colonies were given a plot of land to form a town. The town's leaders were responsible for laying out the town and dividing the land among its inhabitants. They also decided what land to give each individual or family. New England towns had a town center and common lands shared by all townspeople to graze their livestock. Land distribution and ownership was very different in the Southern colonies. People living in this region developed larger tracts of land to grow cash crops. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - High: Stereotypes; Medium: Family dysfunction\">Over time, indentured servants who had served out their contracts were given land.</span> Colonists in Virginia spread westward from the coast along the James River.

They were found in all colonial regions, mostly in coastal towns and cities. Artisans were responsible for providing valuable goods and services, including shipbuilding, carpentry, shoemaking, baking, and silversmithing. Some colonial artisans were master craftspeople who had studied and practiced their trade for many years. To learn a trade, children as young as thirteen worked as an apprentice for a master. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Family dysfunction\">Apprentices were similar to indentured servants.</span> They worked for a set number of years without earning a wage.

        "text_evidence": "As differences of opinion about imperialism continued in the United States, some Americans were already busy establishing businesses and farms in Hawaii. The arrival of European explorer Captain James Cook to this Pacific archipelago in 1778 had sparked interest among other explorers and traders. An 1848 Hawaiian law allowed foreigners to own land. As a result, sugar plantations began to flourish in Hawaii. They were staffed by workers from countries such as China, Korea, Norway, Portugal, the Philippines, and Russia. Sugar exports from Hawaii became big business. Foreign planters gained considerable economic and political influence in Hawaii. In addition to business interests, more than one hundred and eighty Christian missionaries from the United States arrived on the islands between 1820 and 1863. The missionaries had a strong influence on both the religious and political practices of native Hawaiians. The United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii signed the Treaty of Reciprocity in 1875. This agreement enabled products from Hawaii to be sold in the United States without a tariff. The immediate effect of this treaty was that the number of Hawaiian sugar plantations increased from twenty in 1875 to sixty three in 1880. In 1887, with the support of the US. government, planters forced Hawaiian king Kalakaua to accept a new constitution that significantly limited his powers and established a government more favorable to American interests. In 1891, Queen Lili liuokalani came to power in Hawaii. She sought to address the growing influence of the American planters and restore power to the Hawaiian monarchy. Americans in Hawaii rebelled against these efforts in 1893 and, supported by the US. government, overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy. They established a provisional government, and Hawaii was officially annexed by the United States in 1898. However, it would take until 1959 for Hawaii to become the fiftieth American state. The annexation of Hawaii was a major milestone in American expansionism. It solidified the US. presence in the Pacific Ocean, and American businesses gained even greater control over the Hawaiian pineapple, sugar, and banana industries. However, this annexation meant that Indigenous Hawaiian people lost their sovereignty and much self governance. They faced many challenges to their cultural heritage and way of life.",

    "highlighted_text": "The Tennessee State Capitol buzzed with tension on August eighteen, 1920. Legislators filled the chamber. Their voices echoed off marble walls as they prepared for one of the most important votes in American history. The nation watched this single building in Nashville. The fate of women's suffrage hung in the balance. For decades, women across America had fought for the right to vote. They had marched through city streets and organized rallies. They had even gone to prison for their beliefs. The 19th Amendment would guarantee women's suffrage nationwide. It had already passed through Congress. But it needed ratification from thirty six states to become law. Thirty five states had already approved the amendment. This made Tennessee the decisive battleground. The Tennessee legislature was deadlocked. Anti suffrage forces argued that giving women the vote would destroy traditional families. Pro suffrage advocates disagreed. They said democracy demanded equal participation from all citizens. Each side had gathered their supporters. This created a standoff that seemed impossible to break. Among the legislators sat Harry T. Burn. He was a twenty four year old Republican from McMinn County. As one of the youngest members of the Tennessee House of Representatives, Burn had opposed the amendment. He wore a red rose on his lapel. This was the symbol of anti suffrage sentiment. It showed his planned vote against ratification. That morning, Burn had received a letter from his mother, Febb Burn. She lived back home in Niota. Mrs. Burn had followed the suffrage debate closely. She held strong opinions about her son's responsibility. Her letter contained a simple but powerful message: \"Dear Son, Hurrah, and vote for suffrage! Don't keep them in doubt. I notice some of the speeches against. They were bitter. I have been watching to see how you stood, but have not noticed anything yet. Don't forget to be a good boy and help Mrs. Catt put the 'rat' in ratification.\" The reference to Carrie Chapman Catt showed Mrs. Burn's deep knowledge of the movement. Catt was a prominent suffrage leader. Mrs. Burn's playful wordplay about putting the \"rat\" in ratification showed both her wit and her serious commitment to the cause. As the roll call began, tension filled the chamber. When the clerk called \"Burn,\" the young legislator stood. The red rose still decorated his jacket. But his voice carried unexpected words: \"I vote aye.\" Gasps echoed through the gallery. Spectators realized what had happened. Harry Burn had broken the deadlock with a single, decisive vote. The final count showed fifty votes in favor and forty nine against ratification. Tennessee became the thirty sixth state to approve the 19th Amendment. This provided the necessary majority for it to become part of the Constitution. Within days, Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby certified the amendment. This officially granted American women the right to vote. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Bullying or meanness; Medium: Exclusion\">Burn's decision sparked immediate controversy.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Bullying or meanness; Medium: Exclusion\">Anti suffrage legislators accused him of betrayal.</span> Suffrage supporters celebrated his courage. The young legislator later explained his reasoning: \"I know that a mother's advice is always safest for her boy to follow, and my mother wanted me to vote for ratification.\" This single vote transformed American democracy. The 19th Amendment gave voting rights to about twenty six million women. It doubled the eligible voting population overnight. Harry Burn's willingness to reconsider his position showed how individual conscience could reshape history. The letter from Febb Burn represents more than maternal guidance. It embodies the determination of countless women who fought for political equality. Through one young legislator's change of heart, their decades of struggle finally achieved victory.",

    "highlighted_text": "The ancient Maya were a sophisticated people who built a great civilization.

It's possible this event happened over a century or so. Until the 900s, the Maya kept careful historical records. They used their hieroglyphs to carve names and dates on pyramids and temples. Then in the 900s, the writing mysteriously stopped. The temples and pyramids began to fall into disrepair. So what happened? <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Confusing structure; High: Unclear target audience\">Archaeologists have theories, but they can't find clear proof for any one of them.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Violence & Physical Harm; Medium: Mature themes\">One theory is that farmers rose up against the priests and nobles.</span> But this raises another question: What happened to the farmers? <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">There is no evidence of a new group of people replacing the previous people in power.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Complex emotional content\">Some have guessed that disease greatly reduced the Maya population.</span> But no mass burial grounds have been found. Archaeologists have found signs that some people in this area did die from diseases. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Complex emotional content; Medium: Confusing structure; Medium: Missing context; High: Unclear target audience\">However, the greatest number of deaths seem to have occurred after 1500 CE, when the Spanish brought new diseases to the Americas.</span> The early Maya cities were mostly vacant for years before that. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Complex emotional content\">Perhaps the Maya suffered famine as a result of heavy rainfall or drought.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Complex emotional content; Medium: Confusing structure; Medium: Missing context\">Some researchers report that they have found scientific evidence of multiple droughts in the area around the time many Maya cities were abandoned.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">They wonder if clearing the trees to create more land for farming may have led to a decrease in rainfall and a rise in temperatures, worsening the drought.</span> Other researchers disagree. Did disaster strike the Maya? Was there an earthquake? Could invaders have toppled the civilization? Did shifting trade routes affect the lowland Maya rulers and their settlements? It is possible that overland trade routes gave way to more sea based trade routes. This may have occurred because it was more efficient to move goods by sea. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Violence & Physical Harm; Medium: Mature themes\">Many Maya may have elected to move closer to the sea to escape the drought or to escape growing conflict between the city states.</span> No one knows for sure why the once great Maya cities were abandoned and swallowed up by the rainforest. It could be a combination of the reasons researchers have posed. We know that many centuries ago, the Maya left their cities behind. But the people themselves did not disappear. They relocated to new settlements, often closer to the coast. Today, millions still speak languages related to ancient Mayan. These descendants of the pyramid builders have lived in villages, towns, and cities in southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras for centuries. Some carry on the traditions and lifestyle of their ancestors, while others live a modern lifestyle. Many Maya blend traditional and modern ways of life.",

For just a ten dollar filing fee, settlers could stake their claim to one hundred and sixty acres of government land. That was roughly the size of one hundred and twenty football fields. The process began at local land offices across the frontier. Hopeful homesteaders lined up with their applications. They swore they had never fought against the United States government. The law welcomed citizens and immigrants alike. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Misrepresentation\">This included single women and freed slaves.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Misrepresentation; Medium: Missing context; Medium: Exclusion\">However, married women could not file claims on their own.</span> Each applicant got a certificate and six months to begin building their new life. The real challenge started after filing. Homestead law demanded five years of living on the land and farming it. Settlers had to build a home. Even a simple sod house counted. They also had to farm part of their land. Government inspectors would come to check these requirements. They looked at everything from crop yields to building sizes. Daniel Freeman became the first official homesteader. He filed his claim near Beatrice, Nebraska, just after midnight on January one, 1863. His story shows the Act's promise. Freeman was a Union soldier who used his military service to meet residency requirements while stationed nearby. Within decades, his successful farm showed how the legislation could change both individual lives and entire regions. The impact on population was huge. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">Between 1862 and 1934, when the Act finally ended, over one point six million homestead applications were filed.</span> Census data shows how entire states changed almost overnight. Nebraska's population exploded from twenty eight thousand in 1860 to over four hundred and fifty thousand by 1880. Similar patterns happened across Kansas, Colorado, and the Dakotas. Railroad companies advertised the opportunities. Immigrant communities helped each other succeed. Original claim documents tell amazing stories of determination. Swedish immigrants clustered in Minnesota. They brought farming techniques from Scandinavia. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Missing context; Medium: Misrepresentation\">African American homesteaders moved to Kansas.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Misrepresentation\">They created all black towns like Nicodemus, seeking economic independence after slavery ended.</span> Single women made up nearly twenty percent of all homesteaders. This challenged old ideas about frontier life. Agricultural development grew rapidly under the Act's influence. Settlers brought new crops suited to prairie conditions. This included drought resistant wheat varieties. These crops would eventually make the Great Plains America's breadbasket. The legislation encouraged trying new farming techniques. These ranged from dry farming methods to new irrigation systems. The Act's success rate tells a complex story. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">While one point six million claims were filed, only about seven hundred and eighty three thousand homesteaders successfully completed the five year requirement.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Hopelessness\">Harsh weather, crop failures, and isolation defeated many dreams.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Hopelessness\">Some settlers found their one hundred and sixty acres had poor soil or not enough water.</span> Railroad companies and land speculators sometimes cheated the system. They used fake homesteaders to get valuable territory. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">These abuses sparked debates about the legislation's fairness.</span> This led to reforms and additional land laws. The Homestead Act changed American agriculture and settlement patterns forever. It gave two hundred and seventy million acres of public land directly to individual families. That was an area larger than Texas and New Mexico combined. This massive land transfer created the foundation for modern American farming. It established the principle that ordinary citizens deserved opportunities to build wealth through land ownership. The legislation's legacy extends beyond agriculture into American identity itself. It embedded the belief that hard work could transform both landscape and fortune.",

Some make their homes in swamps, mountains, scrublands, and tundra. Not all black bears are black. Those in western areas often have brownish fur. Some black bears in the far north are blue gray or creamy white. Male black bears are larger than females. Some measure more than 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. They can weigh more than 600 pounds (272 kilograms). Black bears move quickly for their size. They can even climb trees with the help of their short, strong claws. Black bears are omnivores. They mainly eat grasses, berries, nuts, and insects. They also dine on fish and carrion. <span class=\"flag-high\" style=\"background-color: #ff6b6b; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"High: Unsafe behaviors modeled\">Black bears also like to eat food left out by humans.</span> <span class=\"flag-high\" style=\"background-color: #ff6b6b; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"High: Unsafe behaviors modeled\">They find these snacks around campsites and hiking trails.</span> <span class=\"flag-high\" style=\"background-color: #ff6b6b; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"High: Unsafe behaviors modeled\">This is dangerous for both the bears and humans.</span> In summer, black bears begin to eat large amounts of food. In fall, they gather leaves and twigs to build a nest in their den. This is how they prepare for winter. In late fall, black bears start their dormant season. They will sleep in their dens for six to seven months. They will not eat, drink, or exercise until spring. In January, female black bears wake up to give birth. Cubs stay in their mom's den for several more months. They nurse while she sleeps. Mom and her cubs leave their den in spring. The cubs will stay with mom for another year.

    "highlighted_text": "Following the Seneca Falls Convention, a series of national women's rights conventions were held annually. These conventions provided a platform for women to voice their concerns, propose reforms, and build alliances. One of the notable figures who made influential speeches was Sojourner Truth, an impassioned advocate for both women's rights and abolition. Truth, a remarkable figure, stood tall both physically and metaphorically. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Mature themes\">She was a formerly enslaved woman who was neither educated nor literate.</span> However, her powerful speaking abilities made her a prominent presence at public meetings advocating for women's rights. Truth defied stereotypes of women's physical weakness by proclaiming her physical strength and ability to perform demanding tasks traditionally associated with men. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Complex emotional content\">Initially, Sojourner Truth was enslaved by a Dutch family.</span> Having been sold four different times, she had to learn English on her own. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Mature themes\">She escaped slavery while carrying her infant daughter.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Complex emotional content\">As a former enslaved woman, Truth became an outspoken reformer for abolition and women's rights.</span> Beginning in the 1830s, she spoke to groups about the importance of ending slavery and instituting women's suffrage. Her autobiography, The Narrative of Sojourner Truth, was written with Olive Gilbert's help in 1850 because she could not read or write. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Low: Formatting artifacts; Medium: Confusing structure\">Onen 1851, Truth was invited to speak at an Akron, Ohio, women's rights conference, where she delivered her famous speech \"Ain't One a Woman?\"</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Low: Formatting artifacts; Medium: Confusing structure\">Onen it, she challenged the idea that women were somehow less able than men.</span> In addition to Stanton, Mott, and Truth, other remarkable women played key roles in the women's rights movement. One of them was Lucy Stone, known for being the first American woman to give a public speech on women's rights. When Lucy Stone married, she made the unconventional decision to keep her own name. Mary Church Terrell, an African American suffragist, fought for equal rights for women of all races. Margaret Fuller challenged gender roles and expectations with her powerful words and intellect. Additionally, Susan B. Anthony made significant contributions by tirelessly campaigning for women's suffrage and equal rights. Susan B. Anthony was an important American reformer. Born in 1820, she dedicated her life to advocating for women's suffrage. Anthony co founded the American Equal Rights Association with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and played a key role in the fight for the Nineteenth Amendment, which extended suffrage to women. Anthony's powerful speeches inspired countless women across the nation to join the suffrage movement. Her determination and relentless efforts made her a trailblazer in the fight for gender equality, leaving a lasting impact on American history. Another influential woman was Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to graduate from a medical college. Her accomplishments paved the way for women in the field of medicine. Amelia Bloomer, who introduced Elizabeth Cady Stanton to Susan B. Anthony, was also part of the movement. She challenged traditional clothing norms by wearing loose, comfortable trousers with a short skirt over them. This practical attire offered women more freedom of movement compared to cumbersome dresses. It took time for significant change to occur. The women's rights movement faced obstacles, but the determination and conviction of these courageous women set the stage for progress. In the following decades, support for increased rights for women would grow. Finally, with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, women won the right to vote.",

    "highlighted_text": "School is over and everywhere children rush out the doors of their schools. But wait! Is it really over for the day? Well, not completely. There is homework to do. In most schools in America, kids have homework every night of school. It usually starts with only a little in kindergarten or first grade, but by high school it can take more than two hours to finish. Homework gives students a chance to practice and remember what they learned in school. However, not everyone thinks homework is a good idea. Some people think students need more time to do other things like sports and music. Some parents wish that their kids had more free time to be with their families. In this book, you will read about different points of view on homework. You will hear from people who think it helps children learn more in school. You will also hear from people who think that there's too much homework and that it's a waste of time. You probably already have ideas about this important topic. See what you think after you read other people's points of view. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">What Science Says About: Homework For over one hundred years people have disagreed about the amount of homework students should get.</span> They have spoken, written, and even passed laws about it. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">Scientists have done studies to find out if it really helps students learn.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">In 1901, California passed a law against giving homework to kindergarten through 8th grade students.</span> The lawmakers argued that children needed time for fresh air and exercise after school. The law also limited how much homework high school students were given. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">However, when the Russians sent the first satellite into space in 1957, Americans started to worry.</span> Why hadn't the United States done that first? <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">Americans worried that their schools were falling behind schools in the rest of the world.</span> Maybe students needed more homework after all. As people's views changed, students began getting homework in many schools. Rules against homework such as California's 1901 law were dropped. But does homework help all students? <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">There are studies that show homework can help students, but in different ways.</span> Homework has been shown to help elementary and middle school students learn good study habits, such as finishing tasks. For high school students, homework can help raise student grades and test scores. However, teachers have to be careful not to give too much homework. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">Scientists have found that too much homework can hurt students by lowering students' grades and test scores.</span> But how much is too much? <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">More than about two and one half hours of homework per night can have a negative effect on students' learning.</span> Based on scientists' findings, the National PTA has made suggestions on the amount of homework students should get every day. As scientists continue to study this question, the National PTA may change its suggestions.",

    "highlighted_text": "In February 1862, the United States government faced a crisis. The Civil War had been raging for nearly a year. The Union treasury was rapidly emptying. Traditional methods of raising money could not keep pace with the enormous costs of war. Something new had to be done. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">Congress made a decision that would change American economics forever.</span> On February twenty five, 1862, President Lincoln signed the Legal Tender Act. This law authorized the printing of one hundred and fifty million dollars in paper currency that was not backed by gold or silver. These bills were printed with green ink on the back. They became known as \"greenbacks.\" <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">For the first time in American history, the federal government created money that got its value from the government's promise alone.</span> This idea challenged centuries of tradition. Before greenbacks, American currency was confusing. Each state bank issued its own paper money. These bills were backed by different amounts of gold or silver. The result was chaos. A merchant might see dozens of different currencies in a single day. Each had uncertain value. The greenbacks were different. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Missing context\">This unbacked currency gained its worth through government decree rather than precious metals.</span> Critics called it \"rag money.\" They predicted economic disaster. They argued that only currency backed by gold or silver could keep stable value over time. Supporters disagreed. They said the government's authority to declare something as legal tender gave greenbacks real value. The Union's survival depended on finding new ways to pay for the war. Traditional funding methods had failed. <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">The Legal Tender Act expanded federal economic power in ways never seen before.</span> The greenbacks created immediate controversy. Some businesses refused to accept the new currency. They preferred gold or silver coins. However, the legal tender provision meant creditors had to accept greenbacks as payment for debts. This government backing slowly built confidence in the new money system. The economic effects were complex. Greenbacks helped finance Union victory. They provided resources to maintain armies and buy equipment. However, printing money without backing also caused inflation. More currency chased the same amount of goods. Prices rose significantly during the war years. This affected both soldiers and civilians. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Confusing structure; Medium: Missing context\">The greenback experiment established important precedents for modern American money policy.</span> The Legal Tender Act showed that the federal government could create a unified national currency. It could regulate that currency's value. This principle later influenced the creation of the Federal Reserve System. It shaped twentieth century economic policy. The success of greenbacks during the war proved that unbacked currency could work. The government's promise to accept the money for taxes and debts gave it real value. Citizens learned to trust paper money that was not backed by precious metals. This trust became the foundation of modern monetary systems. The greenback revolution marked a turning point in American financial history. What began as a wartime emergency became a fundamental shift. Americans learned new ways to think about money, government authority, and economic power. The green tinted bills that helped save the Union also created the foundation for today's American monetary system. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 proved that sometimes the most radical solutions become the most lasting changes.",

Because this labor resulted in protection for them and their families, many worked willingly. Inca farmers raised crops for their families and also for the empire. The Sapa Inca and the priests used only a small part of the goods produced. The rest were stored in warehouses and given to those who were too old or too sick to work. When crops failed and times were hard, food and goods were given to the working people, too. This system ensured that no one went hungry. <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Misrepresentation; Medium: Adult situations; Medium: Violence & Physical Harm; High: Family dysfunction\">The rule of the Sapa Inca was absolute.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Misrepresentation; Medium: Adult situations; Medium: Violence & Physical Harm\">Government officials traveled throughout the empire to make sure his laws were obeyed.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Misrepresentation; High: Lack of supervision; Medium: Confusing structure\">One of those officials was known as He Who Sees Everything.</span> <span class=\"flag-multiple\" style=\"background-color: #9e9e9e; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Multiple issues - Medium: Misrepresentation; High: Lack of supervision; Medium: Adult situations; Medium: Violence & Physical Harm; High: Family dysfunction\">He Who Sees Everything was responsible for visiting Inca villages and making them pay their taxes.</span> <span class=\"flag-medium\" style=\"background-color: #ffa726; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\" title=\"Medium: Confusing structure\">Oddly enough, he also served as a matchmaker.</span> He Who Sees Everything would arrive in an Inca village every few years and order the villagers to gather so that he could take a census.
