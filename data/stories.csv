67cf6300-2f6d-11ef-aee4-f3a5677b5cb1,Helen Keller's Teacher (Chapter One),"There is no friendship more special than that between a student and a teacher. One of the greatest friendships was between Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan. An illness took away Helen Keller's sight and hearing when she was almost two years old, leaving her cut off from the world. For nearly five years, she grew up wild and unruly, expressing her emotions through giggles and chuckles when happy, and kicking, scratching, and screaming when upset. Anne Sullivan arrived at the Kellers' home in Alabama from the Perkins Institution for the Blind in Boston and changed Helen's life. Anne herself was partly blind due to an eye infection. She brought with her experience, unwavering dedication, and love. Through the sense of touch, she was able to make contact with Helen's mind. Within three years, Anne taught Helen to read and write in braille. By the time Helen was sixteen, she could speak well enough to attend school and college. She graduated with honors from Radcliffe and spent the rest of her life helping the blind and deaf blind, just as her teacher had done. The remarkable friendship between Helen and Anne continued until Anne's death. Helen Keller was not like most little girls. She could not see the flowers blooming in her yard or the butterflies flitting from blossom to blossom. She could not hear the birds singing in the treetops or the laughter of other children at play. Helen was both blind and deaf. Because she could not hear people talking, she had never learned to speak. She could follow her mother around the house by clutching her dress but could not say, ""I love you."" She could sit on her father's lap but could not ask, ""Will you read me a story?"" She lived in a dark, quiet world where she felt very alone.",4
56535d30-2157-11ef-aee4-f3a5677b5cb1,The Story of the Star-Spangled Banner (Chapter Two),"On the morning of September thirteenth, the British guns targeted the flag and unleashed a relentless barrage. They fired massive bombshells that often exploded in midair. The attack persisted throughout the day. When darkness fell, the fleet used signal rockets that traced fiery arcs across the night sky. It was a spectacular yet terrifying sight. ""If Fort McHenry can stand, the city is safe,"" Francis Scott Key muttered to himself. He anxiously peered through the smoke to see if the flag was still flying. The young Washington lawyer observed the battle from a small American vessel anchored among the British ships. He had sailed out to the British fleet under a flag of truce before the fighting began. A friend had been captured by the British, and Key had gone to negotiate his release. The British commander agreed but would not let Key return to Baltimore with any information he might have overheard. ""Until the battle is over, you and your boat stay here,"" he ordered. Key had no choice but to wait, pacing the deck and hoping the fort could withstand the onslaught. The bombardment continued without respite. As long as daylight lasted, Key could catch glimpses of the Stars and Stripes through the billowing smoke. When night fell, he could still see the banner intermittently illuminated by the cannon fire. Finally, as dawn approached, the firing ceased. Key strained to see if the flag was still flying. ""Could the fort have held out?"" he wondered. The faint gray light of dawn crept into the sky. He could see a flag flying, but was it American or British? Who held Fort McHenry? He gazed more intently. It grew lighter. A sudden gust of wind unfurled the banner, and it floated out on the breeze. This was no English flag. It was Mary Pickersgill's Stars and Stripes, still waving through the smoke and mist! Fort McHenry had held firm, and the city was safe!",5

And each girl would falsely answer ""Yes."" And his sister would ask, ""With what does he draw his sled?"" And each girl would answer, ""With the hide of a moose,"" or ""With a pole,"" or ""With a great cord."" And then his sister would know that they all had lied, for their answers were mere guesses. And many tried and lied and failed, for Strong Wind would not marry any who were untruthful. There lived in the village a great chief who had three daughters. Their mother had long been dead. One of these was much younger than the others. She was very beautiful and gentle and well beloved by all, and for that reason her older sisters were very jealous of her charms and treated her very cruelly. They clothed her in rags that she might be ugly. They cut off her long black hair, and they burned her face with coals from the fire that she might be scarred and disfigured. And they lied to their father, telling him that she had done these things herself. But the young girl was patient and kept her gentle heart and went gladly about her work. Like other girls, the chief's two eldest daughters tried to win Strong Wind. One evening, as the day went down, they walked on the shore with Strong Wind's sister and waited for his coming. Soon he came home from his day's work, drawing his sled. And his sister asked as usual, ""Do you see him?"" And each one, lying, answered ""Yes."" And she asked, ""Of what is his shoulder strap made?"" And each, guessing, said ""Of rawhide.""",4

It was Fall! They wanted to go the Harvest Fest at the park. ""Can we walk to the park this morning?"" James asked Grandma. ""Sure. Have fun and be safe,"" she said. James and Pat walked to the park. The Harvest Fest was full of fun things to do and see. There were lots of people and colors and smells. Pat and James saw some friends from school there, too. Then they saw a farmer's market. The market had fresh eggs, butter, and milk. It also had yellow corn and things that grow on a farm. The market also had many flowers. Pat smelled the yellow and white flowers. ""That is a daisy,"" said James. ""Look! A tractor!"" said James. A big orange tractor from a farm was parked in the dirt. Pat and James ran to the tractor. Kids could get on it. They had to take turns. Then they saw a big barn. Not a real barn, but a play barn. There was also a real farmer there. He had a goat, a pig, and a rabbit. The kids could pet and feed them. ""I will be a farmer when I grow up. Will you be a farmer with me?"" said Pat to James. ""I want to be a doctor. But I think you will be great farmer,"" he said as they walked home.",2

""Women don't become doctors."" ""I'll prove it's possible,"" Anne replied confidently. ""You're nuts, Anne!"" ""I might be nuts,"" Anne responded, ""but sometimes nuts grow into mighty oak trees."" Anne Austin Young was born in the late eighteen hundreds in Cross Hill, South Carolina. She was a prodigy, demonstrating exceptional intelligence from a young age. At the remarkably young age of fourteen, she enrolled in Presbyterian College. Excelling academically, she graduated as the valedictorian of her class. Following her college graduation, Anne set her sights on a career in medicine, a field primarily dominated by men and generally closed to women during that era. Despite societal norms and even skepticism from some relatives, Anne was driven by her innate talent and a deep seated passion for healing. Her parents supported her ambition wholeheartedly. She pursued her medical studies in Pennsylvania, once again graduating at the top of her class. Anne returned to her home state of South Carolina after completing her medical education. Before she could officially practice medicine, she needed to pass the state medical examination. Anne didn't just pass the exam, she achieved the highest score recorded in the state at that time. In the early years of her practice, Anne navigated the rough roads of Anderson County in an old car, making house calls to attend to her patients. Locals often said, ""There goes that strange woman doctor.""",6

Sadly the bird died. Rose bushes grew from the bird's blood. One day an old woman plucked roses from one of the bushes. When she sniffed the petals, a bird popped out and fluttered over her. She noticed a hairpin in the bird's head and pulled it out. The bird turned into the beautiful Gren. Gren told the woman her story, and the woman ran to tell Zade. Filled with joy, he rushed to Gren.

Great white sharks will bite their prey. Then, they wait for it to die before eating it. Sharks don't chew their food. They use their sharp teeth to tear prey. They swallow the chunks whole. Sharks eat a lot at one time. Sometimes fish are hard to find. They can go a month without eating. Great white sharks are amazing hunters. Their sense of smell helps them find food. They can see well in the dark. They can see up to ten times better than humans. Great white sharks can sense their prey. They can feel where they are in the water. Their prey might try to hide. But a great white shark will find them. Great white sharks are warmer than the water around them. Most fish are cold blooded. But great white sharks can raise their blood temperature. They can live where it may be too cold for other sharks. Great white sharks live alone.",2
23413405-76f1-4f50-9d4f-d78ccdc38e40,The European Theater,"The Allied forces relied heavily on the Atlantic Ocean for transporting troops, equipment, and supplies. The German navy sought to disrupt Atlantic supply lines by deploying U boats to sink Allied ships. A battle of wits and technology unfolded over several years as the Allies worked to outmaneuver German submarines. The Battle of the Atlantic, which took place from 1939 to 1945, was a major military campaign in the European Theater. It was the longest continuous battle of the war. It also directly impacted Allied supply lines and prevented the Axis from receiving crucial resources. By sinking merchant ships, the Allies were able to disrupt enemy logistics and maintain control over the Atlantic. Beginning in late 1942, Operation Torch was an Allied invasion of French North Africa led by US. General George Patton. The success of Operation Torch played a crucial role in weakening Axis influence and shifting the balance of power in favor of the Allies, paving the way for further offensives in Europe. The next year, they became involved in Italy. During this time, the United States joined the ongoing British aerial bombing of German sites. Targets included strategic military and industrial centers and cities inhabited by civilian populations. The firebombing of Dresden, a German city, is one example. Over the course of three days, American and British planes dropped nearly four thousand tons (three thousand, six hundred mt) of high explosives and bombs. Approximately twenty five thousand people were killed. This type of total war, which also took place in the Pacific, resulted in the loss of many innocent civilian lives.",8

776696e0-bec9-11ee-8d3a-d17b627d52c1,The Little Hero of Holland (Chapter Two),"Peter embarked on a journey filled with moments of awe as he paused to admire the beauty of nature. However, the encroaching darkness urged him to quicken his pace. Suddenly, an unusual sound caught his attention, the soft whisper of water seeping through. Investigating further, Peter discovered a small hole in the dike. Recognizing the immediate danger, he understood that even a tiny leak could turn into a disastrous flood. Acting on instinct, Peter dropped the flowers he had collected, descended the side of the dike, and used his finger to seal the breach, stopping the water flow. ""I must contain the angry waters and prevent a flood,"" he resolved. As night fell, the cold intensified, and Peter's arm became numb with pain. Despite calling for help, no one responded. Unbeknownst to his family, who assumed he was safe with his blind friend, Peter faced a dangerous situation alone. Despite the biting cold and growing discomfort, Peter remained focused on his family's safety. ""I cannot let them drown,"" he decided. ""I will endure here until help arrives, even if it means staying all night."" Throughout the night, Peter persevered under the watchful moon and stars, occasionally massaging his aching hand but never letting go. At dawn, a passerby heard faint groans and found Peter clinging to the dike. The alarm was raised, and villagers, armed with shovels, quickly repaired the dike. Peter was taken home, and his heroic act soon became the talk of the town. That night, Peter's courage and kindness were remembered by everyone, and the thankful people in Holland thought of him as their brave young hero forever.",6

4b321910-e4a3-11ed-b492-db8136a8e0a5,Inside the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures (Chapter Two),"The museum features numerous exhibits that include artifacts from classic Hollywood films, rare footage, and interactive installations. Some notable exhibits include the famous ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz, the animatronic shark from Jaws, and original droids from Star Wars. An exhibit allows museum patrons to lay on a patch of grass and watch the clouds go by, immersing themselves in a cozy story world. These exhibits are not just celebratory, though. There is also a clear expression of the full history of the film industry, even the less glamorous aspects. Like many industries or workplaces, the world of filmmaking has a complex political system and a history of discrimination. The Academy has been called out for having an advisory board that does not represent the wider industry, for example. Previously, it remained majority white and male. However, it now reflects the industry more accurately by including people of color and a higher percentage of women. Historically, the treatment of actors, actresses, and set workers has been unsettling. The museum does not shy away from telling these stories. With their upper hand, executives were able to manipulate and mistreat the artists who worked on classic films. Now, there is an awareness of the industry's darker moments in history, which continues to spur accountability. The museum aids in sharing these stories to better educate the public and ignite change within the industry.",6

cb8d1ae0-2f31-11ef-aee4-f3a5677b5cb1,How Robin Hood Met Little John (Chapter One),"Every once in a while, it takes a legendary outlaw to teach lessons about fairness, generosity, bravery, and friendship. Robin Hood and his band of merry men roamed the forests of Sherwood in Nottinghamshire and Barnsdale in Yorkshire. This was during the days when King Richard the Lionhearted was away fighting in the Crusades, and the cunning, greedy Prince John ruled in his absence. In this story, good sportsmanship, grace in victory, and humor in defeat make a good friendship. One day, Robin Hood was traveling through the forest of Barnsdale when he came to a wide stream crossed by a narrow wooden bridge. It was wide enough for only one person to cross at a time and had no railing. Robin had walked a few feet along it when a tall man appeared on the other side and also began to cross. They stopped and frowned at each other when they were about ten feet apart. ""Where are your manners?"" Robin called. ""I was already on the bridge before you stepped on it. Go back!"" ""Go back yourself, acornhead,"" the tall man replied. ""The smaller person should always yield to the bigger one."" ""You're a stranger here,"" said Robin. ""Your rude words show it. But I'll teach you a lesson if you don't step aside and let me pass."" With that, he took up his bow and drew an arrow. The tall man, with a half angry, half amused look, glanced at it. ""If this is how you teach here,"" he said, ""it is a cowardly lesson. Here you are, ready to shoot a man who has only a walking stick for a weapon.""",4
64b34479-94a6-4b64-8693-5422208c1816,The Five Days That Changed History: When Barons Cornered a King,"The meadow at Runnymede stretched green beside the Thames River in June 1215. The air felt thick with tension. King John of England sat across from twenty five of his most powerful barons. These men controlled vast lands and commanded thousands of knights. This wasn't an ordinary meeting. This was a showdown that would reshape how rulers and subjects related forever. For months, the barons had grown angry with their monarch. John had demanded crushing taxes to fund his failed wars in France. He had seized their lands without trial. He had imprisoned their relatives without cause. He had ignored every tradition that had governed English kings before him. The barons had reached their limit. They had captured London and now held the upper hand in this negotiation. The king faced a terrible choice. He could refuse their demands and watch his kingdom tear apart in civil war. Or he could agree to something no English ruler had ever accepted: written limits on royal power. For five long days, the two sides worked out the details of what would become the Magna Carta, or ""Great Charter."" The barons presented their demands carefully. They said the king could no longer imprison free men without a proper trial by their peers. They demanded that he stop seizing property without following the law. Most shocking of all, they required that even the monarch himself must obey the rules. This idea challenged the very foundation of medieval kingship. John's advisors whispered in his ear during breaks. Some urged him to fight rather than give up his absolute power. Others warned that his treasury was empty and his army unreliable. The barons stayed united. They had spent months preparing for this moment. They had talked with church leaders and legal scholars to make sure their demands had solid foundations. The negotiation showed a big shift in how people thought about power and justice. For centuries, kings had claimed to rule by divine right. They answered only to God. The barons weren't challenging John's right to be king. But they were saying that his power had boundaries. They argued that law should stand above personal whim, even royal whim. On June fifteen, 1215, King John finally pressed his royal seal into the wax. This would bind him to the charter. The document had sixty three clauses. These addressed everything from tax collection to the rights of merchants. Clause thirty nine became very important: ""No free man shall be seized or imprisoned... except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."" What happened next proved difficult. John almost right away began looking for ways to break his promises. Civil war broke out within months. The king died the following year, still fighting his barons. But the precedent had been set. Future rulers would face the Magna Carta's principles again and again. Subjects would demand that their leaders respect legal boundaries. The five days at Runnymede had planted a seed. This seed would grow into constitutional government. It would influence legal systems across the world. The idea that law could limit power took root. The idea that rulers must follow rules took root. The idea that people deserved protection from unfair authority took root. All of this happened in a meadow beside an English river, changing human governance forever.",7
6a055525-2e6a-4960-b82d-4fa07d5e0850,Spanish Navigators,"The Portuguese were not the only Europeans exploring the oceans in the 1400s CE. Christopher Columbus was an Italian sailor who believed he could find a new way to get to Cathay. He hoped to secure some of its wealth through trade. Rather than sailing east, Columbus thought he could sail west from Europe. He asked European leaders for money to test his theory. Columbus eventually got support from King Ferdinand Two and Queen Isabella One of Spain. They were willing to take the risk because if Columbus succeeded, Spain could gain wealth and power and also spread Christianity. In September of 1492 CE, Columbus set off westward from the Canary Islands. According to some who sailed with Columbus, many sailors wept. They were fearful of what lay ahead. After a month on the open ocean without any sign of land, the crew threatened mutiny. Many of the men feared they had traveled so far west that they would never find their way back to Europe. But on October twelve, they landed in the Bahamas and then they went farther. When they arrived at an island called Ayti, Columbus thought he had made it to what was then called the East Indies. He assumed, quite wrongly, that the people he met there were inhabitants of the East Indies. He named this island Hispaniola and referred to its people as Indians. Columbus returned to Spain laden with plundered treasure, enslaved people, and news of his success. This achievement led to more support from his patrons, and Columbus left for another voyage in September 1493 CE. Columbus's second and third voyages confirmed that there were plentiful economic opportunities for Spain in the Americas. Ferdinand and Isabella immediately claimed ownership of all land to the west of a point near Cape Verde. They asked Pope Alexander the Sixth to validate their claim. He did. However, the Portuguese complained strongly. They also had claims in the Americas. Soon, a meeting was held in the city of Tordesillas, in Spain, to divide these territories between the two countries. In reality, neither Spain nor Portugal had any real understanding of the extent of the landmass they were claiming. The Treaty of Tordesillas declared that everything to the west of the line drawn west of the Cape Verde Islands belonged to Spain, while everything to the east belonged to Portugal. The treaty also meant that all other European powers had to seek new ways to settle in the Americas. English, Dutch, and French explorers were not willing to be excluded from the Americas by a line drawn on a map. Because of the Treaty of Tordesillas, the crowns of Spain and Portugal considered themselves the true rulers of the Americas. They used this treaty as justification to conquer and exploit the Americas' peoples and lands. Amerigo Vespucci , an Italian navigator, made several trips across the Atlantic between 1497 and 1504 CE. Vespucci's missions were funded by various sponsors, including the powerful Medici family of Florence, now part of Italy. His writings of his journeys made him one of the most famous explorers of his time. Vespucci's findings helped change Europeans' understanding of the world. They also contributed to greater exploration and colonization of the Americas. Vespucci is credited with being the first to recognize that the lands he explored were not part of Asia. He used the term ""New World"" to describe this place. A German mapmaker was so impressed with Vespucci's writings that he labeled the new continent America on the map he was working on.",5

Edwina waved and rode away. The day was nearly over. Just as the sun was setting behind the hills, Delbert heard cries coming from the river. A child was bobbing in the water, shouting, ""I can't swim!"" Delbert leaped into the water feet first, holding his nose. It wasn't until he found himself floundering helplessly that he remembered he couldn't swim either. Sir Baldric crashed out of the bushes, tied a cork tipped arrow to a rope, and shot it across the treacherous waters. The child grabbed it, and Baldric pulled him ashore. Meanwhile, the current carried Delbert downstream. Edwina was standing on a point of land, holding out a long branch to him. Delbert grabbed it and climbed onto the bank. ""You need someone to look out for you."" ""Sir Delbert,"" said Edwina, her eyes twinkling, ""you need someone to look out for you."" Waterlogged, cold, and choking, Delbert looked up at her.

Dear Sister, My husband left me yesterday morning to join General Winder. He inquired anxiously whether I had courage or firmness to remain in the President's house until his return tomorrow, or the succeeding day. And on my assurance that I had no fear but for him, and the success of our army, he left, urging me to take care of myself, and of the Cabinet papers, public and private. I have since received two dispatches from him, written with a pencil. The last is alarming because he desires I should be ready at a moment's notice to enter my carriage, and leave the city. He said that the enemy seemed stronger than had at first been reported, and it might happen that they would reach the city with the intention of destroying it. I am accordingly ready. I have pressed as many Cabinet papers into trunks as to fill one carriage. Our private property must be sacrificed, as it is impossible to procure wagons for its transportation. I am determined not to go myself until I see mister Madison is safe, so that he can accompany me, as I hear of much hostility toward him. Disaffection stalks around us. My friends and acquaintances are all gone. French John, a faithful servant, with his usual activity and resolution, offers to spike the cannon at the gate, and lay a train of powder, which would blow up the British, if they enter the house. To this last proposition I positively object, without being able to make him understand why all advantages in war may not be taken.",5

He never looks in there, and you will be safe."" She opened a huge door that stood in the great hall, and shut him in. But the keyhole was so large that it admitted plenty of air, and he could see everything that took place through it. By and by he heard a heavy tramp on the stairs, like the lumbering along of a great cannon, and then a voice like thunder cried out: ""I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread."" ""Wife,"" cried the giant, ""there is a man in the castle. Let me have him for supper."" ""You have grown old and stupid,"" said the lady in her loud tones. ""You smell only the dinner I have cooked for you. There, sit down and have a good supper."" So the giant sat down at his table.

c9df8bd2-43d3-42bc-8ccc-7b524c92eafd,The Election Of 1800,"John Adams ran for reelection in 1800. Once again, he was opposed by Thomas Jefferson, the leader of the Democratic Republicans. The election of 1800 marked an important moment in the development of political parties. It helped shape the country's political system and paved the way for future elections. The Democratic Republicans were mostly the old Anti Federalists, who had opposed ratifying the US. Constitution without the addition of a Bill of Rights. They believed it was needed to protect individual and states' rights. Adams, on the other hand, remained a Federalist who believed in strong central government. There was plenty of fighting and name calling between the two parties leading up to the election of 1800. Each party had different ideas about what kind of country the United States should be. And the election itself was somewhat confusing and even controversial. As you have read, at that time, the candidate who received the most votes from the Electoral College became president. The runner up then became vice president. However, the results of the 1800 election introduced a new, confusing outcome: Jefferson and his running mate Aaron Burr defeated Adams, but they each received the same number of votes from the Electoral College. This meant that the decision of who should become president moved to the House of Representatives, where members had to vote for a candidate. It took over thirty tries before Jefferson finally won the majority of the votes and became the third president of the United States. Despite all of this confusion, the election ultimately marked the first time in the United States that power was transferred from one political party to another. And it was done peacefully. It also inspired Americans to change the electoral process to avoid similar complications in the future. In 1804, the Twelfth Amendment was added to the Constitution. This amendment stated that instead of casting two votes for president, electors would cast one vote for president and a separate vote for vice president.",7

I opened the door for the gorilla. She was laying in the corner of a cage, holding her impossibly large belly and her face seemed to beg for a hug. A handful of zookeepers looked at me and waited for me to open the door. I turned back and looked at my mother. ""She needs us, Mom,"" I told her. My mom wanted to protest but she nodded. The zookeepers wheeled the cage into my bedroom. I would be bunking with my brother for the foreseeable future. My dad hugged my mother and profusely apologized and appreciated my mother's generosity for a gorilla. Lots of movement happened in my room. There was banging and knocking and yelling in directions. After about an hour, all but one zookeeper left. My father put on his stethoscope and gloves and went into my room. My mother, brother, and I sat down to order pizza for dinner.",6

This last value, helping others, grew from an idea central to their Jewish faith: ""repairing the world."" Sandberg has described how her grandmother sold watches out of the trunk of her car to raise money for the clinic that treated her breast cancer. And her parents carried on a long campaign to free persecuted Jews in the Soviet Union. It is not surprising that helping others is pixelated throughout Sandberg's career. After earning a degree in economics from Harvard University in the year nineteen ninety one, she took a job at World Bank. She wanted to help the bank achieve its mission of decreasing global poverty. Sandberg's job was researching data, but she did have a chance to see what the numbers meant in the real world. She traveled to clinics in remote parts of India, where World Bank funds helped people suffering from the disease of leprosy. She went back to Harvard to get an advanced degree in business. Then, in the year nineteen ninety six, she was hired as chief of staff for the United States Secretary of the Treasury. But political jobs like that one often change hands when a new president is elected. When a Republican president was elected Sheryl decided to take a risk and join the private sector. She accepted a job at what was then a budding tech company called Google. At a press conference in Paris in the year twenty seventeen, Sheryl Sandberg announced that Facebook would help support startup tech companies. It was her next job, however, that made her a household name. Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, met her at a Christmas party in two thousand eight. Recognizing her intelligence and drive, Zuckerberg named her chief operating officer of Facebook. Today she runs the business side of the social media company. That allows developers to focus on what Facebook can do for the two billion people who use it every month. Carrying on her family's tradition, Sandberg has used what she learned leading Google and Facebook to help other people, especially women. Her book ""Lean In"" sparked a nationwide movement to help millions of women overcome barriers. The barriers stop them from achieving the success they would like to have in business.",6

She helped them explore the western United States. The trip was long and hard. She helped them speak and trade with American Indians. People do not know everything about the life of Sacagawea, but she was an important person in history. She was strong and smart. She helped make the country we know today. Sacagawea was born near the Rocky Mountains in the late seventeen hundreds. The area was not part of the United States yet. Today the area is the Lemhi River Valley in Idaho. Her father was a chief of the Shoshone tribe. The Shoshone people moved often. They hunted bison and other animals. They gathered berries and plants. They lived in tepees. The tepees made it easy to move quickly. When Sacagawea was eleven or twelve, another tribe attacked. They were called the Hidatsa. They enslaved Sacagawea. They took her east. Today the area is in North Dakota. The Hidatsa lived with the Mandan tribe. They gave her the name Sacagawea. It means bird woman. These tribes did not move often like the Shoshone. They grew beans, corn, and other crops. They put Sacagawea to work. Then she was sold to a French Canadian fur trader. He made her marry him. His name was Toussaint Charbonneau.",3
1c635eb5-cbdb-4662-b9d5-cf51cdf96976,The War At Home,"If the United States was going to fight in World War One, it would need a large army. So Woodrow Wilson's government decided to institute a draft. The draft meant that young men were required to register with the federal government. And then, because it needed millions of young men for the war, the government drafted into the armed forces many of these young men. With the United States at war, President Wilson created a new government organization, the Committee on Public Information (CPI). Led by George Creel, the CPI set out to present Americans with information about how they could contribute to America's war effort. Creel and those who worked with him recruited thousands of ""Four Minute Men,"" who gave short, four minute speeches in support of America's war effort. ""Four Minute Men"" spoke across America on street corners, in movie theaters, in churches, and in other places where people gathered. The CPI also distributed posters in support of America's war effort to be displayed in stores, banks, and post offices. There were posters of all sorts. One poster, appealing to young men, read, ""Uncle Sam Wants You to Join the Army."" Another poster portrayed a German soldier as a giant, vicious, bloodthirsty ape on the attack. Via these short speeches and posters, as well as movies and pamphlets and other ways, the United States government undertook an active propaganda campaign to build support and enthusiasm for America's involvement in the war. Along with the efforts of the CPI, the American songwriter George Cohan sought to inspire excitement and support for America's war effort. In 1917, the year the United States entered World War One, Cohan wrote a song he titled ""Over There."" By ""over there,"" he meant in Europe. It was a patriotic and popular song, though its critics said that it glorified war. The song sought to inspire young American men to join the US. Army and fight against the Germans. The song's chorus, in which ""the Yanks"" referred to American soldiers, went as follows: Over there, over there, Send the word, send the word over there That the Yanks are coming, The Yanks are coming The drums rum tumming Everywhere. So prepare, say a prayer, Send the word, send the word to beware. We'll be over, we're coming over, And we won't come back till it's over, Over there. Large numbers of men left their jobs to serve in the United States armed forces. At the same time, many women stepped up to work in war industries. They assembled bombs and built airplanes and ships. Women made bandages, sold war bonds, served as trolley car conductors, worked as office clerks, and much more. W. E. B. Du Bois, the African American civil rights leader, urged Black people to serve in the military: ""Let us, while this war lasts . . . close our ranks, shoulder to shoulder with our own white fellow citizens and the allied nations that are fighting for democracy."" Thousands of African Americans served in the United States armed forces in France during the war, though they were required to serve in segregated Black units. Many Americans contributed in other ways, too. For example, they bought Liberty Bonds to help fund the war. If you purchased a Liberty Bond, you gave money to the US. government, and the government would pay you back with a small amount of interest after the war. Rallies large and small were held across the country to urge people to buy Liberty Bonds. Another way Americans contributed on the home front was by planting ""victory gardens."" Given the number of men away at war, there was both an agricultural labor shortage and a need to send food to troops overseas. As a result, the nation faced food shortages and rationing. Many people grew their own fruits and vegetables on small plots of land to help with these shortages and foster a shared sense of purpose by contributing to the war effort from home.",8
1603b5b6-be8a-458c-a37a-e3de2df08117,An Agrarian Society,"Most people living in the thirteen colonies were farmers. This made land ownership an important part of colonial life. How land was distributed varied across the colonial regions. In New England, groups coming to the colonies were given a plot of land to form a town. The town's leaders were responsible for laying out the town and dividing the land among its inhabitants. They also decided what land to give each individual or family. New England towns had a town center and common lands shared by all townspeople to graze their livestock. Land distribution and ownership was very different in the Southern colonies. People living in this region developed larger tracts of land to grow cash crops. Over time, indentured servants who had served out their contracts were given land. Colonists in Virginia spread westward from the coast along the James River. Yeoman farmers became the largest population in all colonial regions. A small part of the population, primarily in the Southern colonies, became large landowners who owned plantations. Enslaved workers did the bulk of the work on these large plantations. They did everything from planting and harvesting to woodwork and metalwork, in addition to carrying out domestic chores in the large plantation homes. Life for enslaved workers was extremely difficult; you'll learn more about the institution of slavery and its effects in the next chapter. Although farming was the main economic activity in the colonies, artisans played an important role in colonial society. They were found in all colonial regions, mostly in coastal towns and cities. Artisans were responsible for providing valuable goods and services, including shipbuilding, carpentry, shoemaking, baking, and silversmithing. Some colonial artisans were master craftspeople who had studied and practiced their trade for many years. To learn a trade, children as young as thirteen worked as an apprentice for a master. Apprentices were similar to indentured servants. They worked for a set number of years without earning a wage. Journeymen were former apprentices who could work for wages. Depending on the trade and their skill level, some artisans could grow very wealthy. Their goods were sold mostly to people locally but also to people in other colonies.",6

The wheel whirred around until it finally began to slow. Mike shut his eyes tight, waiting for the result. Eventually, the wheel ticked to a stop. Carefully, he peeled one eyelid up and then another. The slice of the wheel that his spin had landed upon did not read, ""Win the Gadget,"" but rather ""Become the Gadget."" ""Huh?"" Mike said aloud. Then he noticed that he had not bothered to read any other slices of the wheel. What did it mean to become The Gadget? He turned to the shopkeeper to ask, but before a word passed through his lips, she pressed a button on The Gadget beside them. A ray of light shot out of The Gadget and covered Mike with an electric blue. The world warped around Mike. When he tried to speak, only a series of beeps came out of his mouth! Soon enough, he felt the shopkeeper lift him up and place him on a podium. He looked out onto the street where he had stood so many times admiring The Gadget.

His message was a stirring appeal to the values of liberty, patriotism, and the American ethos, pledging to resist until the end. Despite the call for aid, the Alamo's garrison braced for an imminent siege. Santa Anna's forces encircled the Alamo, intensifying their offensive. Amidst the relentless cannonade, an unlikely sound permeated the air, Davy Crockett playing the fiddle, a resolute attempt to buoy the spirits of his fellow defenders. Eventually, a small reinforcement of thirty two men breached enemy lines to join the defenders, bringing their total to around two hundred. In stark contrast, the Mexican army's strength had swelled to an overwhelming six thousand. Travis convened his men, presenting them with the stark reality, no further help would arrive. He offered them a choice, stay and fight or escape while they could. Legend has it that he drew a line in the sand, inviting those willing to fight to step over it. All but one chose to stay. The assault commenced before dawn, shattering the quiet with the cacophony of battle. The Texan riflemen, from their vantage points atop the walls, repelled the first two waves of the assault. But the third wave proved overwhelming. The Mexican soldiers breached the fortifications, and in a matter of moments, the battle was lost. All the defenders, including Travis, Bowie, and Crockett, perished. The fall of the Alamo came at a significant cost to Santa Anna, both in terms of manpower and time. This delay allowed other Texan forces to prepare and fortify their resolve. ""Remember the Alamo!"" became a rallying cry that galvanized the Texan army. Ultimately leading to Santa Anna's defeat and Texas' independence and ten years later Texas was annexed to the United States. Today, the saga of the Alamo is a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made in the pursuit of freedom. It honors the unwavering courage and commitment to liberty of those who stood against overwhelming odds. This narrative continues to resonate, embodying the spirit of sacrifice for freedom that has been a hallmark of American history.",6
1a7a06e0-6165-11ee-85d9-dbf246165724,The Shark (Chapter Two),"The shark has been called ""the perfect hunter."" It is perfectly adapted for a life spent searching for food. Most sharks are carnivores, which means they eat meat. These meat eating sharks catch and eat fish, including other kinds of sharks! Sharks tend to have sleek, rounded bodies that are shaped like torpedoes. This streamlined shape helps the shark slip quickly through the water. The shark's skin looks smooth and sleek, but It is not. It is, in fact, covered with small, sharp, tooth like scales. These scales make the shark's skin very tough. Sharks have a keen sense of smell, which helps them search for food. A shark can pick up smells from a quarter mile away. The shark's sense of hearing works together with its sense of touch. Its main way of hearing is something called a lateral line. This is a strip of cells that run along the sides of its body and into its head. This line picks up sound and movement. The sounds the shark hears best are at the low end of the sound range, too low for people to hear. It also picks up the slightest water movement. It is alert to any thrashing movements, signs that a fish might be hurt and easy to catch. Sharks see best in dim light, which is why they tend to hunt in early morning or at night. They also have a sixth sense. Every animal gives off a weak electric current when it is in water. Sharks have pores, or small openings, on their heads that tell them where the current is coming from. A fish may lie hidden under the sand on the sea floor, but the shark can still pick up the electric current it gives off. The shark's mouth is perfectly adapted to hunting. Its teeth are quite remarkable. It has several rows of them. Most rows are slanted toward the rear of the mouth. Each row is slightly larger than the last. When the shark bites a victim, its sharp teeth slice through the flesh. The rear teeth hold fast to the victim. It is easy to get something into a shark's mouth, but try getting it back out! The shark always has the same number of teeth. If a tooth is lost, another grows in its place. A shark may grow twenty four thousand teeth in ten years' time. The more we learn about sharks, the more amazing and remarkable they seem!",0

However, as time passed, the woman yearned for the familiar embrace of her earthly home and believed her son should learn about the world. The Sun, understanding his wife's sadness, proposed she visit her old home. The sun extended its rays, and the woman and her son slid down to earth. Not long after their arrival, the village children mocked the young boy, claiming he was fatherless. The boy was very upset. He asked his mother for a bow and arrows. Alone, he went to the village's edge and began shooting arrows to the sky. He created a ladder made of arrows and began the long climb up to see his father. He met his father and said, ""I wish to prove that I am truly your son,"" he explained. ""Allow me to bear your torches for just one day."" The Sun hesitated. ""The smaller torches of dawn and dusk might be manageable, but the torches I use to light up noon time are heavy. They are beyond anyone else's capacity."" Despite his father's caution, the boy persisted. Eventually, the Sun agreed, on the condition that the boy would only carry the small torches. As the new day dawned, the boy, ignoring his father's request only to carry the small torches, ignited every torch. He was eager to show the onlookers below his father's power. Unable to hold on to the torches as his father had warned, the boy dropped some of the torches. This reckless act unleashed a fiery terror upon the Earth, igniting forests, veiling mountains in smoke, and transforming valleys into blistering cauldrons. Wildlife sought refuge in vain, the lakes and streams offered no respite, boiling under the relentless heat. In its attempt to hide, an ermine scorched the tip of its tail, a mark it bears to this day, while a mountain goat found sanctuary in a cave. Witnessing the chaos his son created, the Sun had to make a heartbreaking decision. With profound sorrow, he extinguished his son's fiery ambition, sending him plummeting to Earth like a meteorite. This tale serves as a sad reminder of the limits of ambition and the importance of listening to wisdom, especially when it comes from those who know us best.",6

3e533362-211a-4ef6-a9bf-646589aabfac,The Acquisition Of Hawaii,"As differences of opinion about imperialism continued in the United States, some Americans were already busy establishing businesses and farms in Hawaii. The arrival of European explorer Captain James Cook to this Pacific archipelago in 1778 had sparked interest among other explorers and traders. An 1848 Hawaiian law allowed foreigners to own land. As a result, sugar plantations began to flourish in Hawaii. They were staffed by workers from countries such as China, Korea, Norway, Portugal, the Philippines, and Russia. Sugar exports from Hawaii became big business. Foreign planters gained considerable economic and political influence in Hawaii. In addition to business interests, more than one hundred and eighty Christian missionaries from the United States arrived on the islands between 1820 and 1863. The missionaries had a strong influence on both the religious and political practices of native Hawaiians. The United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii signed the Treaty of Reciprocity in 1875. This agreement enabled products from Hawaii to be sold in the United States without a tariff. The immediate effect of this treaty was that the number of Hawaiian sugar plantations increased from twenty in 1875 to sixty three in 1880. In 1887, with the support of the US. government, planters forced Hawaiian king Kalakaua to accept a new constitution that significantly limited his powers and established a government more favorable to American interests. In 1891, Queen Lili liuokalani came to power in Hawaii. She sought to address the growing influence of the American planters and restore power to the Hawaiian monarchy. Americans in Hawaii rebelled against these efforts in 1893 and, supported by the US. government, overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy. They established a provisional government, and Hawaii was officially annexed by the United States in 1898. However, it would take until 1959 for Hawaii to become the fiftieth American state. The annexation of Hawaii was a major milestone in American expansionism. It solidified the US. presence in the Pacific Ocean, and American businesses gained even greater control over the Hawaiian pineapple, sugar, and banana industries. However, this annexation meant that Indigenous Hawaiian people lost their sovereignty and much self governance. They faced many challenges to their cultural heritage and way of life.",8
30f54e7f-8940-4fb9-bdaa-9d453c8de46e,The Letter That Changed History: Harry Burn's Moment of Decision,"The Tennessee State Capitol buzzed with tension on August eighteen, 1920. Legislators filled the chamber. Their voices echoed off marble walls as they prepared for one of the most important votes in American history. The nation watched this single building in Nashville. The fate of women's suffrage hung in the balance. For decades, women across America had fought for the right to vote. They had marched through city streets and organized rallies. They had even gone to prison for their beliefs. The 19th Amendment would guarantee women's suffrage nationwide. It had already passed through Congress. But it needed ratification from thirty six states to become law. Thirty five states had already approved the amendment. This made Tennessee the decisive battleground. The Tennessee legislature was deadlocked. Anti suffrage forces argued that giving women the vote would destroy traditional families. Pro suffrage advocates disagreed. They said democracy demanded equal participation from all citizens. Each side had gathered their supporters. This created a standoff that seemed impossible to break. Among the legislators sat Harry T. Burn. He was a twenty four year old Republican from McMinn County. As one of the youngest members of the Tennessee House of Representatives, Burn had opposed the amendment. He wore a red rose on his lapel. This was the symbol of anti suffrage sentiment. It showed his planned vote against ratification. That morning, Burn had received a letter from his mother, Febb Burn. She lived back home in Niota. Mrs. Burn had followed the suffrage debate closely. She held strong opinions about her son's responsibility. Her letter contained a simple but powerful message: ""Dear Son, Hurrah, and vote for suffrage! Don't keep them in doubt. I notice some of the speeches against. They were bitter. I have been watching to see how you stood, but have not noticed anything yet. Don't forget to be a good boy and help Mrs. Catt put the 'rat' in ratification."" The reference to Carrie Chapman Catt showed Mrs. Burn's deep knowledge of the movement. Catt was a prominent suffrage leader. Mrs. Burn's playful wordplay about putting the ""rat"" in ratification showed both her wit and her serious commitment to the cause. As the roll call began, tension filled the chamber. When the clerk called ""Burn,"" the young legislator stood. The red rose still decorated his jacket. But his voice carried unexpected words: ""I vote aye."" Gasps echoed through the gallery. Spectators realized what had happened. Harry Burn had broken the deadlock with a single, decisive vote. The final count showed fifty votes in favor and forty nine against ratification. Tennessee became the thirty sixth state to approve the 19th Amendment. This provided the necessary majority for it to become part of the Constitution. Within days, Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby certified the amendment. This officially granted American women the right to vote. Burn's decision sparked immediate controversy. Anti suffrage legislators accused him of betrayal. Suffrage supporters celebrated his courage. The young legislator later explained his reasoning: ""I know that a mother's advice is always safest for her boy to follow, and my mother wanted me to vote for ratification."" This single vote transformed American democracy. The 19th Amendment gave voting rights to about twenty six million women. It doubled the eligible voting population overnight. Harry Burn's willingness to reconsider his position showed how individual conscience could reshape history. The letter from Febb Burn represents more than maternal guidance. It embodies the determination of countless women who fought for political equality. Through one young legislator's change of heart, their decades of struggle finally achieved victory.",8

Now I was going to be the MVP without a doubt. Three minutes We were up by four. Brandon took the ball down and passed it to me. I jumped up to shoot from the side, but suddenly two King players were guarding me instead of one. I lost the ball. The Kings dribbled down and passed the ball to one of their key players. Cole had held him to just four points. Justin, Cole's substitute, couldn't move as fast, and the King player scored. ""You can do it!"" Cole shouted from the bench, but it didn't look good. Every time I got the ball, the Kings double teamed me. Every time I got the ball, the Kings double teamed me. They figured that with Cole gone, they could shut me down and win. Cole had helped divide their attention before, and he'd guarded one of their best shooters. I'd never thought about how much that helped my game. Now we were down by one.

fefab47e-9437-4f0e-bde3-b0f035834ed8,Where Did Everybody Go?,"The ancient Maya were a sophisticated people who built a great civilization. That fact alone is a reason to find them interesting. But one of the most fascinating questions about ancient Maya civilization (two hundred nine hundred CE) is what happened to cause it to end. Archaeologists believe that the Maya left their cities sometime between eight hundred and nine hundred CE. It's possible this event happened over a century or so. Until the 900s, the Maya kept careful historical records. They used their hieroglyphs to carve names and dates on pyramids and temples. Then in the 900s, the writing mysteriously stopped. The temples and pyramids began to fall into disrepair. So what happened? Archaeologists have theories, but they can't find clear proof for any one of them. One theory is that farmers rose up against the priests and nobles. But this raises another question: What happened to the farmers? There is no evidence of a new group of people replacing the previous people in power. Some have guessed that disease greatly reduced the Maya population. But no mass burial grounds have been found. Archaeologists have found signs that some people in this area did die from diseases. However, the greatest number of deaths seem to have occurred after 1500 CE, when the Spanish brought new diseases to the Americas. The early Maya cities were mostly vacant for years before that. Perhaps the Maya suffered famine as a result of heavy rainfall or drought. Some researchers report that they have found scientific evidence of multiple droughts in the area around the time many Maya cities were abandoned. They wonder if clearing the trees to create more land for farming may have led to a decrease in rainfall and a rise in temperatures, worsening the drought. Other researchers disagree. Did disaster strike the Maya? Was there an earthquake? Could invaders have toppled the civilization? Did shifting trade routes affect the lowland Maya rulers and their settlements? It is possible that overland trade routes gave way to more sea based trade routes. This may have occurred because it was more efficient to move goods by sea. Many Maya may have elected to move closer to the sea to escape the drought or to escape growing conflict between the city states. No one knows for sure why the once great Maya cities were abandoned and swallowed up by the rainforest. It could be a combination of the reasons researchers have posed. We know that many centuries ago, the Maya left their cities behind. But the people themselves did not disappear. They relocated to new settlements, often closer to the coast. Today, millions still speak languages related to ancient Mayan. These descendants of the pyramid builders have lived in villages, towns, and cities in southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras for centuries. Some carry on the traditions and lifestyle of their ancestors, while others live a modern lifestyle. Many Maya blend traditional and modern ways of life.",4

Sobek could be represented as a crocodile headed man with the pharoah's crown or as a crocodile with a falcon's head. It was Sobek who is credited with assisting Horus' parents, Isis and Ohsiris, at the time of Ohsiris' death and resurrection. After the god Shawn had killed Ohsiris and scattered the pieces of his body into the Nile, Sobek, in his crocodile form, swam in the river, carrying the pieces to shore. Sobek then helped Isis put Ohsiris back together. Sobek also assisted with the birth of Horus. The Egyptians believed that this scene in the myth demonstrated Sobek's role as a protector of the legitimate ruler of Egypt. Later, when the four sons of Horus were born from the Nile on a lotus blossom, Sobek gathered them in a net and pulled them from the water. The Egyptians honored the four sons as the guardians of the organs of mummies. The Egyptians associated Sobek closely with the Nile. According to one version of his tale, his sweat was its source. There was also a large temple complex in his honor at Kom Ombo, a farming town on the Nile far to the south. Travel a bit further south and you reach what is known today as the First Cataract. For the ancient Egyptians, it represented the source of the Nile. In addition, in his role as a river god, Sobek was considered the creator of the world and key to abundant crop harvests.",5

He decided to send an expedition to find the answers to these and many other questions. Jefferson chose his private secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to lead the expedition. Lewis had also served as a captain in the United States Army. He was an experienced explorer. Lewis asked a friend from his army days, William Clark, to lead the expedition with him. Both men were filled with the spirit of adventure. It was a good thing, too, for there was plenty of adventure and danger ahead of them. The two expedition leaders prepared for the long journey. A group of strong men accompanied them on the trip. They brought large amounts of clothing, tools, and medical supplies. They also brought guns. Even though the explorers were bringing several tons of food, they would have to hunt for most of what they would eat. They would also have to protect themselves from any dangers. On their journey, Lewis and Clark would take notes on the landforms, lakes and rivers, plants, animals, and people and villages they encountered. They would collect samples of useful plants, and they would make maps. Lewis and Clark knew they would be meeting and dealing with many groups of Native Americans. They brought along many things to trade and to give as gifts, including two thousand, eight hundred fishhooks and four thousand, six hundred needles, as well as colored beads, silk ribbons, and mirrors. Finally, the group was ready to leave. On a clear morning in May 1804, the Corps of Discovery climbed into their boats on the Missouri River near the town of St. Louis. Besides Lewis and Clark, the Corps of Discovery included soldiers and experienced explorers. There were also interpreters who spoke various Native American languages. One other key person who was part of the expedition was an enslaved man named York. York would become the first African American to cross the continent. The men began their journey and paddled their boats upstream. The group journeyed along the Missouri River, but the trip wasn't easy. They were going upriver on rafts, boats, and canoes. They could not just let the river carry their boats. They had to row and push the boats the entire way. Each day they traveled between ten and twenty miles. After several months, the Corps of Discovery reached what is now North Dakota. They stopped at a village of the Mandan people, a Native American tribe. The Mandan were used to housing the fur traders who came through the area. While the Mandan people welcomed the expedition, not all Native American groups did so. Many were suspicious of their motives. The Corps of Discovery spent the winter in the village. They repaired their equipment and built six new canoes. They also learned all they could from the Mandan people about the land and the other Native American tribes they might meet along the way.",3

American forces sank four Japanese aircraft carriers and a cruiser and destroyed numerous aircraft. This victory dealt a major blow to the Japanese navy, halting its expansion and forcing it into a defensive stance for the rest of the war. From 1942 to 1945, American forces engaged in an island hopping campaign in the Pacific in their advance on Japan. They bombed, shelled, and conducted amphibious assaults on islands like Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Tarawa, and Saipan. The Battle of Leyte Gulf was another important battle in the war. It took place in October 1944 in the waters surrounding the Philippine island of Leyte. Involving both American and Japanese forces, this battle marked the largest naval engagement in history. It also signaled the beginning of the end of Japan's naval control in the western Pacific. US. forces further weakened the Japanese navy and paved the way for Allied advances toward the Japanese mainland. The battle also allowed US. forces to begin liberating the Philippines, which had been under Japanese occupation since 1942. Two and a half years after he left, MacArthur returned to retake the Philippines. After wading ashore, he declared, ""People of the Philippines, One have returned"". By early 1945, US. forces were closing in on Japan. They sought to capture the islands of Iwo Jima and Okinawa as bases for further attacks. Members of the Navajo Nation in the United States, called the Navajo code talkers, were instrumental in the ensuing Allied victories. Code talkers used their native language to create a code that the Japanese could not decipher. Their services played a vital role in maintaining secure lines of communication amidst the challenging and chaotic conditions on Iwo Jima. After thirty six days of fierce fighting in February and March 1945, US. forces captured the small volcanic island of Iwo Jima. A month later, the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific took place in Okinawa, against which the Japanese deployed kamikaze attacks. Kamikaze attacks consisted of pilots who flew aircraft loaded with explosives and deliberately crashed into enemy targets. These pilots knew that they would die. The three month ground campaign on Okinawa was successful but resulted in eighty thousand US. casualties.",8

b3e81888-e455-4595-8b92-620ecaa31c51,160 Acres of Promise: The Homestead Act's Great Gamble,"On May twenty, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed legislation that would reshape America. The Homestead Act offered something new: free land to anyone willing to claim it. For just a ten dollar filing fee, settlers could stake their claim to one hundred and sixty acres of government land. That was roughly the size of one hundred and twenty football fields. The process began at local land offices across the frontier. Hopeful homesteaders lined up with their applications. They swore they had never fought against the United States government. The law welcomed citizens and immigrants alike. This included single women and freed slaves. However, married women could not file claims on their own. Each applicant got a certificate and six months to begin building their new life. The real challenge started after filing. Homestead law demanded five years of living on the land and farming it. Settlers had to build a home. Even a simple sod house counted. They also had to farm part of their land. Government inspectors would come to check these requirements. They looked at everything from crop yields to building sizes. Daniel Freeman became the first official homesteader. He filed his claim near Beatrice, Nebraska, just after midnight on January one, 1863. His story shows the Act's promise. Freeman was a Union soldier who used his military service to meet residency requirements while stationed nearby. Within decades, his successful farm showed how the legislation could change both individual lives and entire regions. The impact on population was huge. Between 1862 and 1934, when the Act finally ended, over one point six million homestead applications were filed. Census data shows how entire states changed almost overnight. Nebraska's population exploded from twenty eight thousand in 1860 to over four hundred and fifty thousand by 1880. Similar patterns happened across Kansas, Colorado, and the Dakotas. Railroad companies advertised the opportunities. Immigrant communities helped each other succeed. Original claim documents tell amazing stories of determination. Swedish immigrants clustered in Minnesota. They brought farming techniques from Scandinavia. African American homesteaders moved to Kansas. They created all black towns like Nicodemus, seeking economic independence after slavery ended. Single women made up nearly twenty percent of all homesteaders. This challenged old ideas about frontier life. Agricultural development grew rapidly under the Act's influence. Settlers brought new crops suited to prairie conditions. This included drought resistant wheat varieties. These crops would eventually make the Great Plains America's breadbasket. The legislation encouraged trying new farming techniques. These ranged from dry farming methods to new irrigation systems. The Act's success rate tells a complex story. While one point six million claims were filed, only about seven hundred and eighty three thousand homesteaders successfully completed the five year requirement. Harsh weather, crop failures, and isolation defeated many dreams. Some settlers found their one hundred and sixty acres had poor soil or not enough water. Railroad companies and land speculators sometimes cheated the system. They used fake homesteaders to get valuable territory. These abuses sparked debates about the legislation's fairness. This led to reforms and additional land laws. The Homestead Act changed American agriculture and settlement patterns forever. It gave two hundred and seventy million acres of public land directly to individual families. That was an area larger than Texas and New Mexico combined. This massive land transfer created the foundation for modern American farming. It established the principle that ordinary citizens deserved opportunities to build wealth through land ownership. The legislation's legacy extends beyond agriculture into American identity itself. It embedded the belief that hard work could transform both landscape and fortune.",8

The teahouse owner quoted a price that was the same as for a full bowl of stew. ""So it is. Then I will pay the bill for Zain,"" replied Muhammad firmly, surprising Omar and Zain. ""Omar, you quoted the price for a full bowl of stew, but I will pay for the steam that flavored Zain's dry bread."" Muhammad took out the moneybag attached to the broad, cotton belt around his waist. He carefully counted out a few coins for the price of a full bowl of stew. Standing by the table, he held the coins in his fist high above his head. The eyes of the men, who were very confused, followed his every move. Muhammad let go of each coin, letting them drop to the table with a clink and bounce away. Once the last coin had dropped, Omar, very annoyed, stooped over slowly to retrieve the coins from where they had landed on the ground. But Muhammad was faster. Bending over quickly, he scooped up the coins in his hand and dropped them back into his moneybag. ""What are you doing? That is my money!"" shouted Omar angrily. ""Your money? That is my money. I have already paid in full,"" Muhammad said, sitting down comfortably on the bench once again. He wished to resume his nap that had been interrupted. ""Steam and sound are like brothers who float together upon the air,"" Muhammad continued. ""The sound of the coins clinking on the table have paid you well for the steam of the stew rising from your kettle.""",5
5eccf260-0977-11eb-8a99-238a1e6e21be,Black Bears,"Black bears are the most common bears in North America. These mammals are found across Canada, the United States, and northern Mexico. Most black bears live in forests. Some make their homes in swamps, mountains, scrublands, and tundra. Not all black bears are black. Those in western areas often have brownish fur. Some black bears in the far north are blue gray or creamy white. Male black bears are larger than females. Some measure more than 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. They can weigh more than 600 pounds (272 kilograms). Black bears move quickly for their size. They can even climb trees with the help of their short, strong claws. Black bears are omnivores. They mainly eat grasses, berries, nuts, and insects. They also dine on fish and carrion. Black bears also like to eat food left out by humans. They find these snacks around campsites and hiking trails. This is dangerous for both the bears and humans. In summer, black bears begin to eat large amounts of food. In fall, they gather leaves and twigs to build a nest in their den. This is how they prepare for winter. In late fall, black bears start their dormant season. They will sleep in their dens for six to seven months. They will not eat, drink, or exercise until spring. In January, female black bears wake up to give birth. Cubs stay in their mom's den for several more months. They nurse while she sleeps. Mom and her cubs leave their den in spring. The cubs will stay with mom for another year. She protects them as they learn to survive on their own!",2

In exchange, the king of France gave much of Louisiana, including New Orleans, to Spain. Louisiana became a Spanish colony. After the war ended, France gave its land in present day Canada to Great Britain. The Acadians, a group of people who spoke French, lived on that land. The British forced thousands of Acadian people to leave Canada. Many of them moved to Louisiana. ""Evangeline"" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is a famous poem about the Acadians' hard journey. Cajun people in Louisiana are the descendants of the Acadian people. Thousands of people also came to New Orleans from Haiti during the late 1700s and early 1800s. Many of these people were free and enslaved Africans. They brought Haitian culture, such as music and dance, to New Orleans. Antoine Morin, a free man of color from Haiti, invented a way to produce sugar from sugar cane. This brought the sugar industry to Louisiana. Spain found it difficult to govern Louisiana because of its size and diverse culture. Louisiana was home to Native Americans and peoples from Africa and Europe.",1

a320fe06-d6ea-4c32-a53d-3da0294729e5,Other Heroes,"Following the Seneca Falls Convention, a series of national women's rights conventions were held annually. These conventions provided a platform for women to voice their concerns, propose reforms, and build alliances. One of the notable figures who made influential speeches was Sojourner Truth, an impassioned advocate for both women's rights and abolition. Truth, a remarkable figure, stood tall both physically and metaphorically. She was a formerly enslaved woman who was neither educated nor literate. However, her powerful speaking abilities made her a prominent presence at public meetings advocating for women's rights. Truth defied stereotypes of women's physical weakness by proclaiming her physical strength and ability to perform demanding tasks traditionally associated with men. Initially, Sojourner Truth was enslaved by a Dutch family. Having been sold four different times, she had to learn English on her own. She escaped slavery while carrying her infant daughter. As a former enslaved woman, Truth became an outspoken reformer for abolition and women's rights. Beginning in the 1830s, she spoke to groups about the importance of ending slavery and instituting women's suffrage. Her autobiography, The Narrative of Sojourner Truth, was written with Olive Gilbert's help in 1850 because she could not read or write. Onen 1851, Truth was invited to speak at an Akron, Ohio, women's rights conference, where she delivered her famous speech ""Ain't One a Woman?"" Onen it, she challenged the idea that women were somehow less able than men. In addition to Stanton, Mott, and Truth, other remarkable women played key roles in the women's rights movement. One of them was Lucy Stone, known for being the first American woman to give a public speech on women's rights. When Lucy Stone married, she made the unconventional decision to keep her own name. Mary Church Terrell, an African American suffragist, fought for equal rights for women of all races. Margaret Fuller challenged gender roles and expectations with her powerful words and intellect. Additionally, Susan B. Anthony made significant contributions by tirelessly campaigning for women's suffrage and equal rights. Susan B. Anthony was an important American reformer. Born in 1820, she dedicated her life to advocating for women's suffrage. Anthony co founded the American Equal Rights Association with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and played a key role in the fight for the Nineteenth Amendment, which extended suffrage to women. Anthony's powerful speeches inspired countless women across the nation to join the suffrage movement. Her determination and relentless efforts made her a trailblazer in the fight for gender equality, leaving a lasting impact on American history. Another influential woman was Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to graduate from a medical college. Her accomplishments paved the way for women in the field of medicine. Amelia Bloomer, who introduced Elizabeth Cady Stanton to Susan B. Anthony, was also part of the movement. She challenged traditional clothing norms by wearing loose, comfortable trousers with a short skirt over them. This practical attire offered women more freedom of movement compared to cumbersome dresses. It took time for significant change to occur. The women's rights movement faced obstacles, but the determination and conviction of these courageous women set the stage for progress. In the following decades, support for increased rights for women would grow. Finally, with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, women won the right to vote.",7

There is homework to do. In most schools in America, kids have homework every night of school. It usually starts with only a little in kindergarten or first grade, but by high school it can take more than two hours to finish. Homework gives students a chance to practice and remember what they learned in school. However, not everyone thinks homework is a good idea. Some people think students need more time to do other things like sports and music. Some parents wish that their kids had more free time to be with their families. In this book, you will read about different points of view on homework. You will hear from people who think it helps children learn more in school. You will also hear from people who think that there's too much homework and that it's a waste of time. You probably already have ideas about this important topic. See what you think after you read other people's points of view. What Science Says About: Homework For over one hundred years people have disagreed about the amount of homework students should get. They have spoken, written, and even passed laws about it. Scientists have done studies to find out if it really helps students learn. In 1901, California passed a law against giving homework to kindergarten through 8th grade students. The lawmakers argued that children needed time for fresh air and exercise after school. The law also limited how much homework high school students were given. However, when the Russians sent the first satellite into space in 1957, Americans started to worry. Why hadn't the United States done that first? Americans worried that their schools were falling behind schools in the rest of the world. Maybe students needed more homework after all. As people's views changed, students began getting homework in many schools. Rules against homework such as California's 1901 law were dropped. But does homework help all students? There are studies that show homework can help students, but in different ways. Homework has been shown to help elementary and middle school students learn good study habits, such as finishing tasks. For high school students, homework can help raise student grades and test scores. However, teachers have to be careful not to give too much homework. Scientists have found that too much homework can hurt students by lowering students' grades and test scores. But how much is too much? More than about two and one half hours of homework per night can have a negative effect on students' learning. Based on scientists' findings, the National PTA has made suggestions on the amount of homework students should get every day. As scientists continue to study this question, the National PTA may change its suggestions.",4

Fighting under the leadership of General ""Black Jack"" Pershing, whom you may remember reading about, the Americans ended the bloody stalemate in western Europe and turned the tide of the war. At the same time as the US. military was entering World War One, a series of revolutions was occurring in Russia. A new regime in Russia signed a treaty with Germany in 1918 and ended most Russian involvement in World War One. The arrival of American troops in France was decisive. Decisive means that the United States' entry into the war troop force in Europe was central to the defeat of Germany in 1918. While the arrival of American troops changed the course of the war, it was accompanied by great losses. In World War One, fifty three thousand, four hundred American soldiers died in combat; another sixty three thousand died in noncombat deaths. In Europe, and in the fighting that occurred in some of the European colonies around the world, a total of some nine million soldiers died. In 1918, the assistant secretary of the navy and future US. president Franklin Roosevelt toured the Western Front. He later recalled what he had witnessed there: ""One have seen war. One have seen war on land and sea. One have seen blood running from the wounded. . . . One have seen the dead in the mud. One have seen cities destroyed. . . . One have seen children starving.

Why are there shopping centers for people to buy what they need, and residential neighborhoods for people to live in? The way our communities are shaped and designed were influenced by many people. Meet, Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the city planner. Imagine a time long ago when there was no city where Washington, District of Columbia now stands. It was Pierre Charles L'Enfant, a French architect, who envisioned creating a beautiful capital city for the United States. L'Enfant carefully planned the city's layout with broad avenues, grand buildings, and the stunning Washington Monument in the center of it all. Pierre Charles L'Enfant was like a master artist, but instead of painting on canvas, he painted with streets, buildings, and open spaces. His vision for Washington transformed it from a simple piece of land into a magnificent city. He wanted this city to be a symbol of freedom and democracy, where important decisions for the whole country would be made. One of L'Enfant's brilliant ideas was to create wide, tree lined avenues that crisscrossed the city. These wide roads made it easy for people to move around, adding a touch of grandeur to the cityscape. Can you imagine how impressive it must have been for the people of that time to walk along those broad avenues?",3

He had a dream of expanding his territory to grow his kingdom. And he did just that. Alexander the Great is famous for creating one of the largest empires in ancient history. He led his army to conquer lands far beyond Macedonia, including Egypt, Persia, and parts of India. Alexander's conquests spread Greek culture and ideas to many different places, mixing with local cultures and influencing them. Alexander also inspired countless stories and legends about his adventures and battles. People remember him not just as a king who conquered lands, but also as a character in many tales of heroism and exploration. And while many celebrate him, there are others who find his conquest brutal. In conquering so many lands, he also caused many deaths, and the displacement of people. Regardless, Alexander the Great's legacy is a big part of history. The cities he founded and the spread of Greek culture helped shape the development of Western civilization. Even though his empire broke apart after he died, the blending of cultures, known as Hellenistic culture, continued to influence people for centuries. Alexander the Great was more than just a king, he was one of the most successful military leaders in history. His bravery, vision and ambition lead him to extraordinary achievements.

Roughly two thousand United States soldiers, under the command of General William Hull, waited inside. Outside Isaac Brock led around one thousand British soldiers. Shawnee chief Tecumseh joined him with several hundred of his own men. A white flag rose from inside the fort. Hull had surrendered before the battle even began. He had more soldiers. He had the protection of the fort. Still, he feared Tecumseh and his warriors. For most of Tecumseh's life, he had fought against white settlers taking Shawnee land. When the War began, he sided with the British. He believed they would help the tribes defeat the colonists. On this day, it looked like it could be possible. Tecumseh was born at the end of the seventeenth century. His people, the Shawnee, lived in Indiana Territory, in what is Ohio and Indiana today. Around that time, settlers began occupying Shawnee lands in current day Kentucky. As they pushed farther into already occupied territory, they were met with resistance. Tecumseh's father was killed defending his home. Tecumseh's brother, took over as head of the family. He took Tecumseh to Historic Shawnee sites that have been found.

Many colonists considered this yet another threat to their freedom. In Boston, troops seemed to be everywhere. People jeered at the soldiers and tried to make their lives miserable. Tensions also grew when soldiers took jobs that the colonists believed should have been theirs. Fights between colonists and soldiers broke out in several cities. On March five, 1770, an event worse than a street fight occurred in Boston. A crowd gathered around a lone British soldier on guard duty and started shouting insults and throwing snowballs. The frightened soldier called for help, and more British soldiers arrived. For reasons that are unclear, the soldiers turned their guns on the angry crowd and started shooting. Five colonists were killed or wounded, including a sailor named Crispus Attucks. Attucks was an African American man with Native American ancestry, and he is now considered the first person to die for the cause of American liberty. Bostonians called the killing a massacre. After the Boston Massacre, some colonists believed it was time to break away from Great Britain. Most colonists were loyal to their king, but increasing numbers of colonists talked about separation. They began to believe they could only keep their liberties if they were free from Britain. Samuel Adams of Boston was one of the colonists who believed in independence. After the massacre, Adams and others created a way to alert colonists if the British government threatened their liberties again. In 1772, they set up a Committee of Correspondence, which soon spread to other colonies. These committees became the fastest way to get news out within each colony and from one colony to another. Slowly, the idea of independence spread throughout the colonies.",6

Through the rest of 1861, the Union won a series of victories. In early 1862, a Union army under the command of General Ulysses S. Grant was fighting in western Tennessee. Grant was a brilliant general who believed that victory lay in aggressively attacking the Confederacy. He had served in the Mexican American War and had a reputation as a tough soldier. In February 1862, he had captured Fort Donelson in Tennessee. Grant had forced the fort to surrender with no conditions attached. He pressed on. In early April, Grant led his forces toward Corinth, Mississippi, intending to capture an important rail junction there. Both armies relied heavily on the railroads during the Civil War to move troops and supplies. Cutting off a major railway would be a strategic victory. But Confederate generals Albert S. Johnston and Beauregard led the Confederate Army in a surprise attack on Grant's forces. They engaged the Union forces at a place called Pittsburg Landing. Heavy fighting broke out around Pittsburg Landing, including at a church called Shiloh Church. The Union Army retreated from the attack but soon collected itself, received reinforcements, and began to fight back. The Confederates were ultimately unable to hold their position and were forced to retreat. Shiloh was another Union victory, but it came at a high price. Both sides were surprised at their heavy losses in the Battle of Shiloh more than twenty three thousand casualties in total. The Battle of Shiloh hurt Grant's reputation. But despite this early setback, Grant would go on to show aggressiveness and resilience unlike any other Union leader. He would become one of the great heroes of the Civil War.",7

69eeb901-add5-4dea-ab3e-2740eb00f09d,The Paper Revolution: How Green Money Changed America Forever,"In February 1862, the United States government faced a crisis. The Civil War had been raging for nearly a year. The Union treasury was rapidly emptying. Traditional methods of raising money could not keep pace with the enormous costs of war. Something new had to be done. Congress made a decision that would change American economics forever. On February twenty five, 1862, President Lincoln signed the Legal Tender Act. This law authorized the printing of one hundred and fifty million dollars in paper currency that was not backed by gold or silver. These bills were printed with green ink on the back. They became known as ""greenbacks."" For the first time in American history, the federal government created money that got its value from the government's promise alone. This idea challenged centuries of tradition. Before greenbacks, American currency was confusing. Each state bank issued its own paper money. These bills were backed by different amounts of gold or silver. The result was chaos. A merchant might see dozens of different currencies in a single day. Each had uncertain value. The greenbacks were different. This unbacked currency gained its worth through government decree rather than precious metals. Critics called it ""rag money."" They predicted economic disaster. They argued that only currency backed by gold or silver could keep stable value over time. Supporters disagreed. They said the government's authority to declare something as legal tender gave greenbacks real value. The Union's survival depended on finding new ways to pay for the war. Traditional funding methods had failed. The Legal Tender Act expanded federal economic power in ways never seen before. The greenbacks created immediate controversy. Some businesses refused to accept the new currency. They preferred gold or silver coins. However, the legal tender provision meant creditors had to accept greenbacks as payment for debts. This government backing slowly built confidence in the new money system. The economic effects were complex. Greenbacks helped finance Union victory. They provided resources to maintain armies and buy equipment. However, printing money without backing also caused inflation. More currency chased the same amount of goods. Prices rose significantly during the war years. This affected both soldiers and civilians. The greenback experiment established important precedents for modern American money policy. The Legal Tender Act showed that the federal government could create a unified national currency. It could regulate that currency's value. This principle later influenced the creation of the Federal Reserve System. It shaped twentieth century economic policy. The success of greenbacks during the war proved that unbacked currency could work. The government's promise to accept the money for taxes and debts gave it real value. Citizens learned to trust paper money that was not backed by precious metals. This trust became the foundation of modern monetary systems. The greenback revolution marked a turning point in American financial history. What began as a wartime emergency became a fundamental shift. Americans learned new ways to think about money, government authority, and economic power. The green tinted bills that helped save the Union also created the foundation for today's American monetary system. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 proved that sometimes the most radical solutions become the most lasting changes.",8

""You are going to take Adam's place?"" he asked. ""Yes,"" Nathan said. ""Chad asked for my help."" At recess, Chad and Nathan practiced their dance. They swayed and hopped and spun. They took a break. Then they did it all again. By the end of recess, they were ready. At the talent show, Emily juggled soccer balls. George played a flute while riding a unicycle. Michael made Shaw disappear. It was quite a show! Nathan and Chad took the stage. Their heads bobbed to the music. They spun and danced and swayed. At the end, they each did a backflip. When they landed with their fists in the air, the class cheered. After the show, Mister Dave talked to Nathan. ""It was kind of you to dance with Chad,"" Mister Dave said. ""Well,"" Nathan said, ""it was not a hard choice. I was just supporting my friend.""",2

You start your journey in the Southeast, in the woods of the Mississippi Valley. For thousands of years, people we now call Mound Builders lived in the Midwest and Southeast regions of what is today the United States. They were part of what is known as the Mississippian culture. They were farmers who built settlements and traded with people in other areas near and far. Their network of roads and trade routes spanned the entire Mississippi Valley, stretching east and also as far west as the Pacific Ocean. The Mound Builders' society broke apart with the arrival of Europeans. Over time, many new nations formed from the old one, each sharing many cultural beliefs and practices with the others. The Mound Builders get their name from the large mounds they built of soil. Very early mounds were often small and round on top. Over thousands of years, the mounds became larger, with flat tops. The largest mound still standing today, Monk's Mound, is one hundred feet (three hundred and five m) tall. This was one of more than a hundred other mounds at the Cahokia archaeological site. Although many mounds were round, others were built in various shapes, such as large birds or snakes. The mounds were used for many purposes, including religious rituals and burial of the dead. However, we may never know the full story of how the mounds were used. This information was lost when the Mound Builder society broke up after the arrival of Europeans. During the height of their society, the Mound Builders of the Mississippian culture were farmers. They settled in one place and grew corn, squash, and beans. They also traded with other nations and built cities, roads, and marketplaces. When Europeans began to arrive in North America in the 1500s CE, the Mound Builder society was greatly impacted. New methods of trading affected traditional ways of life. In addition, the Mississippian people could not fight off the germs and diseases carried by the Europeans. Over the next two centuries, many people died.",5
6fa23c2f-313f-4fc2-b16e-d32cd03a19df,For The Good Of The Empire,"In addition to working for their families, Inca men were required to spend part of their time working for the Sapa Inca and the empire. They had to work on construction projects, build roads, or serve in the military. The mandatory work of the Inca men helped maintain the empire and its network of roads. Because this labor resulted in protection for them and their families, many worked willingly. Inca farmers raised crops for their families and also for the empire. The Sapa Inca and the priests used only a small part of the goods produced. The rest were stored in warehouses and given to those who were too old or too sick to work. When crops failed and times were hard, food and goods were given to the working people, too. This system ensured that no one went hungry. The rule of the Sapa Inca was absolute. Government officials traveled throughout the empire to make sure his laws were obeyed. One of those officials was known as He Who Sees Everything. He Who Sees Everything was responsible for visiting Inca villages and making them pay their taxes. Oddly enough, he also served as a matchmaker. He Who Sees Everything would arrive in an Inca village every few years and order the villagers to gather so that he could take a census. The more people in the village, the more the village had to pay in taxes. Once the counting was over, He Who Sees Everything asked unmarried women over a certain age to step forward. The official interviewed each young woman, and if one was found especially worthy, she was sent to Cuzco to become one of the Sapa Inca's many wives. Once these chosen few had been selected, He Who Sees Everything called all the unmarried young men before him. He proceeded to pair off the young men and women. He could make dozens of marriages on the spot. No questions were asked. After all, He Who Sees Everything was a servant of the Sapa Inca, and the marriages he was arranging were for the good of the empire.",5
