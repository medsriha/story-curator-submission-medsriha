## Sensitive Content Requiring Review

The following issues should be flagged for human review with specific text locations:

### 1. Violence & Physical Harm

- **Threatening behavior or language**: Characters threatening to harm others

**Severity levels:**

- **Mature themes**: Divorce, death, substance use, romantic relationships
- **Complex emotional content**: Trauma, grief, mental health
- **Frightening imagery**: Monsters, darkness, being lost or trapped
- **Adult situations**: Work stress, financial problems, adult relationships

**Considerations:**

- Grade level of target audience
- How themes are framed (educational vs. gratuitous)
- Presence of resolution or support

### 3. Cultural Sensitivity & Representation

- **Stereotypes**: Character portrayals based on race, gender, nationality, etc.
- **Outdated terminology**: Historical terms that are now considered offensive
- **Misrepresentation**: Inaccurate or disrespectful portrayal of cultures
- **Bias in roles**: Limited or stereotypical gender/cultural roles
- **Othering language**: Language that creates "us vs. them" dynamics

### 4. Emotional Safety

- **Bullying or meanness**: Characters being unkind without consequence
- **Shame or humiliation**: Content that ridicules or embarrasses
- **Family dysfunction**: Unhealthy family dynamics without context
- **Exclusion**: Characters being left out or rejected
- **Hopelessness**: Situations without positive resolution

### 5. Technical & Pedagogical Issues

- **Unclear target audience**: Mismatch between complexity and stated grade
- **Factual errors**: Incorrect information presented as fact
- **Confusing structure**: Text that is hard to follow
- **Missing context**: References requiring outside knowledge

### 6. Physical Safety Concerns

- **Unsafe behaviors modeled**: Children doing dangerous activities
